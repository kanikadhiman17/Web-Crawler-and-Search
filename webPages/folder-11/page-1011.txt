The Geospatial Platform (GeoPlatform) is a strategic national resource that supports the Administration's–Open Government, Open Data and Digital Government strategies to enhance transparency, collaboration and participation. The GeoPlatform provides a suite of well‐managed, highly available, and trusted geospatial data, services, and applications for use by Federal agencies—and their State, local, Tribal, and regional partners to meet their mission needs and the broader needs of the Nation. The GeoPlatform was developed by the member agencies of the FGDC through collaboration with partners and stakeholders. The GeoPlatform is being implemented to help agencies meet their mission needs, including communicating with and publishing data and maps to the public. The GeoPlatform focuses on web applications that facilitate participatory information sharing, interoperability, user‐centered design, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. The GeoPlatform is a key component connecting many goals of the NSDI Strategic Plan in advancing the NSDI. The portfolio of data, applications, and services provided on the GeoPlatform is stewarded through the use of open licenses and careful review and hosted on cloud infrastructure that maximizes geospatial interoperability. The GeoPlatform provides streamlined access to National Geospatial Data Assets and reduces data duplication. The collaborative GeoPlatform Marketplace helps reduce data acquisition costs. GeoPlatform's many tools and dashboards support the A-16 Portfolio Management process.
