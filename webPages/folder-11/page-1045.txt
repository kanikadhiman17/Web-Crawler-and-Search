How does the realization that multiple agencies are working on very similar projects and the concept of coordination and collaboration spark the concept of data sharing? How does one learn if geospatial data exists, where to find it, how to evaluate it? The metadata program journey has had its ups and downs and encountered hazardous curves and rocky roads. Obstructionists and “nay-sayers” were plentiful. How does a small program overcome inertia to covet, protect, and internalize data? This presentation shares the progression of the program from duckling to fledgling stage and focuses on the program’s activities that result in successes in the federal, state, local, academic, and Tribal sectors. • The why of and what is the Executive Order? • “Corporate” metadata support • “Don’t duck Metadata”- the program • Stumbling blocks • Program successes • Performance strategies Sharon Shin provides leadership to metadata enthusiast representing multiple governmental levels, academia, private sector, and non-governmental agencies. Eight years in two federal geospatial programs has provided Sharon with many experiences, challenges, and successes. Sharon’s current role is Metadata Coordinator for the Federal Geographic Data Committee Secretariat. The FGDC is a program which spans across departments of the U.S. Government’s Executive Branch, the military service branches, state, local, academia, Tribal governments, as well as the private sector. Metadata elders told her “train metadata and see the world” and that it has. Spanning the U.S., partnering with federal Canadian agencies, and counseling international organizations; metadata has presented her with a passport of enriching encounters while training geospatial metadata.
