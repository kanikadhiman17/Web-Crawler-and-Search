Each year the AIAS honors individuals and groups for their exemplary work in areas such as leadership, collaboration, scholarship and service. “Despite 2021 being the year that it was, we saw an amazing set of submissions! Our jury had a tough time narrowing down many of the categories to just a handful of winners. The AIAS prides itself on its resiliency and the awards this year showcased just that – the dedication and hard work of our members during these challenging times. Whether or not you submitted for an award, a huge shoutout to everyone that has managed to keep FBD moving forward despite being virtual for a majority of the year,” said said 2019-2020 AIAS National Vice President and 2021 Honor Awards Jury Co-Chair, Adam Fogel. Fellow Co-Chair and 2020-2021 AIAS National Vice President Sara Taketatsu also shared that, “It’s remarkable that despite the virtual year we had, there was still so much tremendous work being done within the AIAS. Even though we are still celebrating everyone virtually, the accomplishments of the awardees are more impressive and worth even more honor. These awards remind us what is possible when we prioritize our community and strive to improve ourselves as the next generation of architecture and design professionals.” The AIAS Honor Awards were developed to publicly recognize outstanding achievements by students, educators, and practitioners who have exhibited an exemplary commitment to the education and development of architecture students. The AIAS is thrilled to add these individuals and chapters to the long list of exemplary members of the organization. The AIAS community joined in congratulating them and their hard work during a special Honor Awards ceremony at the virtual AIAS FORUM 2022 Denver | CONVERGE conference.
