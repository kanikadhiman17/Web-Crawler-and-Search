The AIAS is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to linking its student constituents to the diverse academic, social, and creative opportunities that are critical in their development as design professionals. At the heart of all AIAS activities is a cooperative effort designed to transform today’s students into the architect and design professionals of tomorrow. This includes not only an active and involved student membership but also a close and mutually supportive role for faculty, professionals, the design community, and the corporate community who contribute to the advancement of the art and science of architecture. Each year the AIAS honors individuals and groups for their exemplary work in areas such as leadership, collaboration, scholarship, and service. The AIAS Honor Awards were developed to publicly recognize outstanding achievements by students, educators, and practitioners who have exhibited an exemplary commitment to the education and development of architecture students.
