It is charged with the identification, prioritization, implementation, coordination, and oversight of strategies and tasks required to support the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and to coordinate Federal geospatial programs to that end. The Coordination Group is accountable to, and provides recommendations to, the FGDC Steering Committee and its Executive Committee, which are the policy‐level interagency authorities responsible for providing leadership and direction to the FGDC. Coordination Group members and alternates are appointed by each FGDC member agency’s Senior Agency Official for Geospatial Information (SAOGI), who serves as the agency’s FGDC Steering Committee member. The CG also recommends the establishment of FGDC Subcommittees and Working Groups and reviews their workplans and progress updates regularly at standing meetings.
