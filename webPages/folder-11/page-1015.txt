The guidance provides important information regarding the processes Federal agencies will use to utilize the Marketplace capability of the Geospatial Platform to help avoid duplicative creation and acquisition of geospatial data. The guidance was developed by an interagency consortium of FGDC partners, and the policy and procedures can be adapted and customized specifically to agency requirements for utilizing the Marketplace. The Marketplace is important to meeting requirements described in OMB Circular Aâ€“16 Revised and Executive Order 12906 and an important action identified in the NSDI Strategic Plan. The Geospatial Platform Marketplace provides a listing of datasets that are planned for acquisition by one or more of the FGDC member agencies. The listing can be used to determine whether a potential partner is already trying to acquire data where there is an interest. Marketplace functionality is constantly being enhanced in new releases of the Geospatial Platform to help Federal agencies and their partners meet their geospatial data needs in the most timely and cost-effective manner possible.
