Similar to a library catalog record, metadata records document the who, what, when, where, how, and why of a data resource. Geospatial metadata describes maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) files, imagery, and other location-based data resources. The FGDC is tasked by Executive Order 12906 to enable access (see GeoPlatform.gov) to National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) resources and by OMB Circular A-16 and the A-16 Supplemental Guidance to support the creation, management, and maintenance of the metadata required to fuel data discovery and access.
