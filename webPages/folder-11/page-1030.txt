The Strategy was created to provide Federal CIOs and key stakeholders guidance on the implementation of shared IT services as a key part of their efforts to eliminate waste and duplication and reinvest in innovative mission systems. The strategy covers the spectrum of IT shared service opportunities throughout the Federal Government and promotes the use of existing and new strategic sourcing methods where agencies can combine their buying power for similar IT needs and get lower prices and improved service leverage in the process. Accompanying this strategy is the Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture, which provides agile, standardized methods and tools for designing the next generation of IT resources and shared services that agencies needed to successfully accomplish their missions in the face of tight resources and rising customer needs. The Geospatial Platform is the Shared Service that evolved from the Geospatial Line of Business. About The Geospatial Line of Business (Geo LoB) aims to further refine the opportunities for optimizing and consolidating Federal geospatial-related investments to reduce the cost of government and, at the same time, improve services to citizens. Cross-agency coordination of geospatial activities can identify, consolidate, and reduce or eliminate redundant geospatial investments. Developing the Geo LoB will result in a more coordinated approach to producing, maintaining, and using geospatial data, and will ensure sustainable participation from Federal partners to establish a collaborative model for geospatial-related activities and investments. Vision The Nationâ€™s interests are served, and the core missions of Federal agencies and their partners are met, through the effective and efficient development, provision and interoperability of geospatial data and services. Goals and Objectives Goal 1: Productive intergovernmental collaboration for geospatial-related activities and investments across all sectors and levels of government Objective 1.1: To improve governance processes and results in alignment with common geospatial solutions Objective 1.2: To identify, evaluate and implement common geospatial services, processes and best practices Objective 1.3: To enhance coordination among geospatial community stakeholders Goal 2: Optimized and standardized common geospatial functions, services, and processes which are responsive to customers Objective 2.1: To implement guidance provided through the FEA Geospatial Profile Objective 2.2: To adopt, deploy and promote effective use of geospatial interoperability standards Objective 2.3: To establish a Geo LoB-wide business architecture for common functions associated with geospatial information Goal 3: Cost efficient acquisition, processing, and access to geospatial data and information. Objective 3.1: To coordinate geospatial requirements and capabilities Objective 3.2: To identify opportunities and consolidate geospatial acquisition activities Objective 3.3: To enhance Geo LoB-wide portfolio management Objective 3.4: To develop and implement geospatial requirements language for Federal grants and contracts The Geo LoB has served as the organizational umbrella to plan and begin development of the Geospatial Platform and for the execution of SmartBUY. Workgroups The Geospatial Line of Business (Geo LoB) was organized around seven Work Groups. FGDC had been assigned responsibility for these work groups by the OMB. The Geo LoB Work Groups focused on cross-agency geospatial issues related to geospatial policy, business requirements, and business management processes. In May 2010, these groups were retired in preparation for standing up the ad-hoc work groups that developed the initial approach and content for the Roadmap for Modernization for the Geospatial Platform.
