The plan, which covers the years 2021-2024, was approved by the FGDC Steering Committee in November 2020. The NSDI strategic plan was developed with inputs from a variety of sources, including FGDC agencies, the National Geospatial Advisory Committee, and geospatial partner organizations. The plan describes a broad national vision and mission for the NSDI, and includes goals and objectives for the continued sustainable development of the NSDI. The FGDC will work collaboratively with partners on implementation of the plan. Additional information will be posted here regarding the implementation phase.
