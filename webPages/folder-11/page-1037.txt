Each subcommittee focuses on issues that pertain to coordination and standards associated with a geospatial data theme with regard to data collection, access, exchange, and applications using those data. Many of the FGDC subcommittees actively assist in the implementation of the NGDA Management Plan and, in fact, many members of the subcommittees are designated as NGDA Theme Leads or NGDA Dataset Managers. Members of the subcommittees have updated and (or) registered NGDA Dataset metadata that is harvested for the Data.gov and Geoplatform.gov catalog. These actions increase opportunities for discovery, access, and shared use of the NGDA Datasets. The subcommitteesâ€™ members are supporting the NGDA Theme and Dataset maturity assessments, which are critical to providing relevant and meaningful information for decision making by senior executives.
