Geospatial information has been proven effective in supporting both the understanding of and response to disasters. However, the ability to effectively share, use, and reuse geospatial information and applications across and between governments and nongovernmental organizations in support of disaster response and resilience is dependent upon having the required partnerships, policies, standards, architecture, and technologies already in place when disaster strikes. Geospatial Data and Technology for Preparedness, Response, and Recovery The OGC Spatial Data Infrastructures for Disaster Resilience initiative was initiated in 2018 to understand how to best support the development of, or combination of SDI(s) for the use in disasters, to advance the understanding of stakeholder issues, and serve stakeholdersâ€™ needs. Quality, up-to-date geospatial data and tools are central to citizen access to governmental programs and, in addition, are an important means for Federal Agencies to interact and communicate with local communities and citizens. Geospatial data and tools also have the potential to save lives, limit damage, and reduce the costs of dealing with emergencies. Disasters point out the need for integrated solutions, including on-the-ground emergency response capabilities informed by geospatial tools and technologies. Geospatial applications are critical for preparedness activities, response to events, and post-disaster management. Geospatial tools play an increasing role in disaster response by improving communication through spatial data, providing capacity for interagency and intergovernmental approaches to address disasters, and facilitating long-term strategies for recovery efforts, risk reduction, restoration, and monitoring programs.
