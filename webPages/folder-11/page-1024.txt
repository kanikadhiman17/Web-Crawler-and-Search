The FGDC will continue to collaborate with the National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) to review and develop common approaches to understand and address the issue of geolocation privacy, including continuing feedback and advice on emerging geospatial privacy issues and policy developments. The FGDC has also partnered with the Privacy Committee of Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council to jointly address geospatial privacy issues, informing the Federal Privacy Officersâ€™ community about the growing importance of geospatial privacy and the need to avoid unintended consequences for the geospatial community as new regulations and statutes addressing privacy issues are considered.
