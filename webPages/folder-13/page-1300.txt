OK USG Vaccination Locator All University System of Georgia (USG) students, including incoming students, now have access to COVID-19 vaccination sites on 15 campuses statewide. Students can use this tool to locate and schedule a first or second shot at the USG campus closest to them, whether or not it’s where they are enrolled. In addition to vaccination sites at these USG institutions, students can locate vaccination sites through the Georgia Department of Public Health’s vaccination locator as well. Since the beginning of the pandemic, USG has worked closely with the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Governor’s Office and Task Force to make sure our students keep learning and stay healthy. Campuses have already administered tens of thousands of vaccine doses and will continue to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available to their campus communities. As a part of that effort, all USG students now have access to 15 campus vaccination sites statewide regardless of which institution they attend. The interactive map above and the table below include the Georgia Department of Public Health-approved vaccination sites at USG institutions. While USG strongly encourages all faculty, staff, students and visitors to get vaccinated, it is not mandatory. Getting vaccinated is an individual decision and not required to be a part of our campuses. If you have any questions, contact vaccination@usg.edu.
