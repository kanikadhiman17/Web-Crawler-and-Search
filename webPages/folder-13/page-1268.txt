The policies contained herein are either derived directly from the Board of Regents Policy Manual, Section 8.0, Personnel, Section 3.0, Academic Affairs, or they are administrative policies, as authorized by the Chancellor of the University System of Georgia by virtue of the delegated authority from the Board of Regents, that are critical to the effective administration and operation of a complex University System and its member institutions. The policies provide information about working conditions, employee benefits, and policies affecting employment. Human Resources officers and institutional managers should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of this manual. Also, institutions may develop institutional level policies that comply with these policies. The policies contained herein also outline responsibilities for employees and programs developed by the University System of Georgia to benefit employees. No policy manual can anticipate every circumstance or question that may arise in an employment situation. As the University System of Georgia continues to develop, change and grow, the need may arise and the University System of Georgia reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of the manual from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. This policy manual applies to the University System of Georgia and its member institutions. When the term “institution” is used in this manual, it shall include all institutions within the University System of Georgia and the University System Office which employs individuals in executive, professional, administrative and staff support positions. Should you have any questions or need clarification on any policy outlined within this manual, please feel free to contact the Vice Chancellor for Human Resources or any member of the Human Resources team. These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Chancellor of the University System of Georgia or designee.
