The new model that replaced it was the result of a two-year, cross-functional and cross-institutional initiative that reduced the job classification structure from almost 1,700 titles to about 200 job categories. The changes positively impacted a broad range of organizational activities, including strategic planning, human resources, budget management, institutional research, information systems, and EEO/Affirmative Action activities. Built upon IPEDS federal reporting requirements, the new system: Eliminated obsolete, mandatory job titles Supported consistent legal compliance and reporting across 34 institutions, and Created flexibility & reduces shadow systems at the campus level The new model “went live” on August 27, 2003.
