X close window 2B Professionals with Academic Rank Those individuals that may be afforded academic status by tradition or by virtue of their institutional roles. Some institutions treat such positions – such as librarians, registrars, researchers, or counselors (typically with terminal degrees) – as faculty-equivalent. Other institutions may appoint such positions as non-academic professionals (if the latter, they are categorized in the 400 series). X close window 4K Agriculture/ Forestry/ Marine/Aeronautics Professionals Includes individuals who work in such areas as agriculture, animal care, forestry, marine, and aeronautics fields. X close window 6F Facilities Paraprofessional/Professional Includes individuals who work in such areas as agriculture, animal care, forestry, marine, and aeronautics fields. X close window 9C Limited Term Unlike regular positions, which are ongoing positions with no defined or determined ending, Limited Term positions are created or budgeted for some defined period that is expected to be at least 6 months, but that is not expected to continue indefinitely. Typical examples are positions that are created or funded through grants or sponsored projects, where the life cycle of the grant may be one to three years. Other examples are positions only for a limited period due to a special campus project or need. Limited Term positions of at least 50% FTE are benefits-eligible, and must be posted/advertised just like a regular position. Positions expected to exist for more than 3 years should be established as regular positions. X close window 9D Temporary Positions Temporary positions may be filled for up to 6 months, and may be full- or part-time. Temporary positions are not benefits-eligible, regardless of FTE. Departments may seek an extension of a Temporary appointment for up to six additional months (12 consecutive months total). However, under BOR Policy, once the individual has worked for the institution for 12 consecutive months, the employment relationship must end. The individual may not be rehired as a Temp in the same institution unless there has been a break in service of at least 30 calendar days. X close window 9E Occasional Occasional positions are similar to temporary positions. An individual with an “occasional” appointment works sporadically, but might work on a recurring basis, as needed, over a period longer than 6 months. Examples might include an individual who works in the Admissions Office during every peak registration period, or a stagehand who builds sets for performances a few times per year. These individuals may work full- or part-time for brief periods, but their total FTE over the course of a year should not exceed 49% of the time. Occasional positions are not benefits-eligible.
