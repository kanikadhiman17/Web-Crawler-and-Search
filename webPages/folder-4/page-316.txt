Additionally, consider how best to serve student and research needs through non-traditional schedules and online opportunities. For example, consider using modified or alternative/flexible working arrangements and work schedules, in addition to teleworking/telecommuting. In all that we do, we should reflect on the following guiding principles to make decisions regarding the various types of flexible arrangements. Discussion Prompts & Considerations Managing Virtual Teams Managing In-Person Teams Getting Started Prior to having one-on-one conversations with your employees, we recommend reviewing the applicable flexible work policies to determine the overall best option for everyone involved. Engage in individual conversations with all team members to determine both Institute, department, and employee needs, keeping in mind our guiding principles noted above. Additional prompts and considerations can be found here to help guide your conversation. In addition, you may request your employee complete the Team Blueprint prior to meeting with you to determine their optimal working styles and environments. Not sure if your employee can telecommute or adopt flexible hours? Revisit our guiding principles and consult with your unit's leader to understand their vision for the department. If you need additional guidance, contact your HRBP or HR College Representative to assist. Consider location/geography considerations It is important that before allowing workers to exercise flexible work arrangements, each employee reports the state from which they will perform the work so Georgia Tech can evaluate whether the university will take on additional tax and unemployment insurance responsibilities. For additional assistance with out-of-state questions, consult your HRBP or HR College Representative. Consider accessibility needs If special equipment is needed to accommodate a disability, ensure your department can provide the resource enabling the employee to perform essential functions. For additional assistance regarding accessibility resources, contact Ann Harris in GTHR or the Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation. Confirming Flexible Work Arrangments Once a flexible work arrangement has been agreed upon, complete the necessary documentation. Ensure you have noted when each employee intends to exercise flexible work arrangements and that you have a master calendar that outlines those plans for the entire team. As a people leader, communicate and document both yours and your employee’s expectations regarding their flexible work arrangement. Ensure you reference these expectations often and communicate quickly if expectations are not met.
