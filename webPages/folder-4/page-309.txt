Their current coverage may be sufficient for their travel needs. However, some trips warrant additional coverage. For example, France requires visitors to have medical evacuation and repatriation coverage in order to receive a work visa, and security evacuation coverage may be very important in some parts of the world. The current USG medical plans do not include all of these provisions. Travel insurance with basic ERS (evacuation, repatriation, and security) might be needed. In addition, some medical plans may have high deductibles or cumbersome reimbursement requirements when using out-of-plan providers. Therefore, a traveler may choose to supplement their existing regular medical insurance plan with more robust medical travel insurance. Consult this guide to determine which travel insurance is appropriate for you. Need Assistance? Visit ServiceNow to request support.

Therefore, in addition to BlueCross BlueShield or Kaiser Permanente, J-1 employees must purchase an additional policy. Stand-alone Medical Evacuation & Repatriation insurance is available from ACSA Global Travel Plus. On the enrollment site select “Enroll Now,” and scroll to "Provide Your Information." Evidence of both a USG employee health policy and the evacuation & repatriation coverage, is required to complete the J Scholar OIE check-in process and ensure the DS-2019 is activated in SEVIS. Additional information about J Exchange Visitor’s Health Insurance requirements is available on the Office of International Education website here. Important: the ACSA Global Travel Plus evacuation and repatriation coverage only covers the J Exchange Visitor employee while in the United States. If a J-1 employee travels outside the U.S., they may be covered by Redpoint or elect to purchase one of the CISI travel insurance options noted above on this page.
