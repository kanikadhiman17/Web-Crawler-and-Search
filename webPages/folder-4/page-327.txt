Is there a new hire in your department who exhibits visionary leadership? Are you the team member who regularly identifies problems, but focuses on potential solutions? Then take the time to nominate them, or yourself, for a Staff Award. The Staff Awards recognize employees for outstanding achievements over and beyond their regular job duties and who model Georgia Tech’s core values and vision for the future. There are a total of 12 awards. All faculty and staff, regardless of job function, are eligible and encouraged to submit a nomination. The nomination process ends on Friday, Feb. 17. “The act of being nominated, whether you win or not, does wonders for employees' sense of belonging, retention, and well-being. It shows that someone values you, that you are integral to the mission of the Institute, and it motivates you to continue doing great work,” said Mattie Smyth, GTHR program manager for recognition, who manages the Staff Awards process. Award recipients are selected by a cross-functional campus committee and will be recognized at the Georgia Tech Faculty and Staff Honors Luncheon on Friday, April 21. Additional information on the awards, nomination criteria and instructions can be found at hr.gatech.edu/staff-awards.
