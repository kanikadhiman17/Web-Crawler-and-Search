Some examples include going to the Sojourn Adventures for zip-lining and laser tag, helping to donate clothes and food to the homeless in Atlanta with Food4Lives, or even going to the MLK King Center. We even created our own large-scale, campus project two years ago called Jackets Beyond Walls. Excursions will help provide outside-the-classroom learning experiences for students, as well as allow the community to develop organically. Impact Service Responsibility and ROI Each resident will contribute to the management of the community in different ways by volunteering, serving with community organizations, and participating in Impact service events. Second-year Impact students can serve as Team Leaders for Impact GT1000 courses. Additionally, they will serve as mentors and work alongside our Living Building Equity Champion students.
