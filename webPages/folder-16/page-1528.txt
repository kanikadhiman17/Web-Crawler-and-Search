OHI fosters an inclusive, supportive campus environment through scholarships and fellowships, support of current students and student organizations, outreach initiatives, Latino Welcome Night and Hispanic Heritage Month events, and more. We collaborate with and provide support to various Georgia Tech administrative and academic units, including Undergraduate Admission, Office of Development, Women’s Resource Center, Alumni Association, Graduate Studies, Student Diversity Programs, Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, School of Modern Languages, Center for Academic Success, and Office of International Education, among others. We also develop and cultivate relationships with the Hispanic/Latino community beyond Georgia Tech, including corporate Hispanic employee resource groups, community leaders, Prospánica, Latinos in Information Sciences and Technology Association, Georgia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, World Chamber of Commerce, Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce, and Latin American Business Chamber, among others. Students, faculty, and staff enjoy Hispanic Heritage Month events to celebrate and recognize the economic, scientific, cultural, and social contributions of Latinos.
