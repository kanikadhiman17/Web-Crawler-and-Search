Staff Diversity, Inclusion, and Engagement offers six ERGs to build community and ensure that employees experience a greater sense of belonging. These voluntary employee associations, organized around common dimensions of diversity, have been designed to offer forums where employees can enhance their employment experience. Web of Brilliance promotes the interests of individuals who self-identify as introverts and educates those who work with or otherwise interact with introverts. Web of Brilliance provides a forum for introverts to explore and honor their unique gifts, as well as a safe space to examine the quiet nature of their significant contributions. WEB also provides a safe haven for introverts to explore solutions to challenges introverts may face in extrovert-ideal workplaces, brings active awareness to the impact that introversion and extroversion have on work styles and the Georgia Tech environment, and provides strategies for leveraging a broad range of strengths across the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Web of Brilliance strives to: highlight the skills that introverts contribute to the Georgia Tech community; serve as a resource to support the success of introverts by creating an environment in which introverts thrive professionally and personally; reframe being an introvert as an asset – an interesting aspect of one’s identity teach members how to develop extroverting skills as needed to thrive while celebrating introverted ways of functioning; provide meaningful activities and opportunities for introverts to educate and promote their interests.
