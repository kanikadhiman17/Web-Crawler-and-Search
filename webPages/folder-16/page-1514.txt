Each year, the Diversity Champion Awards recognize those who demonstrate a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Georgia Tech community. This year’s recipients should have demonstrated a commitment to advancing inclusion and creating an environment where students, faculty, and staff feel a sense of belonging at Georgia Tech within the last three years. Awards are given to one staff member, one faculty member, one student, and one unit (office, department, or lab), and will be presented to recipients at the 2022 Diversity Symposium in September. Nominations, including those by previous nominees and self-nominations may be made by any Georgia Tech student, faculty, or staff member for any award category, and will be accepted until July 16, 2022.
