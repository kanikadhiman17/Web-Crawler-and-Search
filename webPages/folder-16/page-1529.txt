One of the findings from Georgia Tech’s Climate Assessment Survey in 2012 was expressed feelings of marginalization by gender and race/ethnicity among students. Embracing student diversity and different perspectives is critical to the success of the campus community. Since 2002, OHI has offered programs and events to recruit, enrich, retain, and promote the success of Hispanic/Latino students at Georgia Tech. We foster an inclusive, supportive campus environment through scholarships and fellowships, support of current students and student organizations, outreach initiatives, Latino Welcome Night and Hispanic Heritage Month events, and more. Since the inception of OHI, more than 270 Hispanic/Latino students have been supported by The Goizueta Foundation Scholarships and Fellowships to date. Currently, we serve more than 1,500 undergraduate and graduate Hispanic/Latino students. If interested in learning more about OHI, I encourage you to visit the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion to take a tour of the renovated Chapin Building and meet our talented staff. To increase capacity to serve more current and future students, we welcome partnerships with foundations and donors. This website provides you with more information about what we’re currently working on and gives you a chance to contact us with any questions you may have. My colleagues and I welcome your suggestions to help us grow this important endeavor at Georgia Tech.
