Feb 4, 2022 | Atlanta, GA Philonise Floyd, activist and brother of the late George Floyd, will be the featured speaker at Georgia Tech’s 2022 Black History Month Lecture on Wednesday, February 9 from 3–4:15 p.m. Floyd was working as a professional transporter when he learned that his older brother George Floyd Jr. was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a police officer with the Minneapolis Police Department, an event that sparked worldwide protests condemning racism, brutality and a lack of accountability among police officers. “We are honored to have Mr. Floyd share his story with the Georgia Tech community,” said Archie Ervin, vice president for Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. “His decision to turn his pain into purpose has inspired millions around the world to fight in the face of police brutality and systemic racism.” Floyd and his wife Keeta founded the Philonise and Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change to advance awareness and advocacy and promote stability within global communities to support the protection of human rights through a commitment to social justice, equity-focused reforms, and eradicating systemic racism. The lecture is sponsored by the Georgia Tech African American Student Union, Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Student Engagement and Well-Being.
