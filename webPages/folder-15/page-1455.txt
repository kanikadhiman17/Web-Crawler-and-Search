The summit enables meaningful and sustainable research exchanges between female engineers from around the world while identifying issues faced by females pursuing careers in engineering who could benefit from a global strategy. This initiative periodically receives funding from the National Science Foundation, the European Science Foundation, and others to support the attendance of women at the summit.
