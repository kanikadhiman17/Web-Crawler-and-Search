Often, these organizations face numerous challenges in building diverse, inclusive, and equitable communities, as the organizational culture must shift to ensure that the lived experiences of those communities reflect these values. During the 14th annual Georgia Tech Diversity Symposium Illusions of Inclusion: Invisible Barriers to Belonging, we will explore and attempt to better understand the systemic and institutional challenges that organizations must overcome in order to create a more inclusive community. Join us for a day full of important conversations with Georgia Tech students, faculty, staff, and renowned scholars who will share their thoughts and expertise on creating an environment where every person can feel a sense of belonging.
