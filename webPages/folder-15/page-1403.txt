The Campus Climate Survey challenges students, faculty, and staff to provide honest feedback about their experiences as part of the Georgia Tech campus community. As the first survey conducted under the 2030 Institute Strategic Plan, the results of this survey will set new baseline data essential to informing Institute-level decisions over the next decade. Campus Climate Survey FAQs What is the Campus Climate Survey? The Georgia Tech Campus Climate Survey began as a charge from then-Provost Rafael L. Bras in 2012 to gather data from the Georgia Tech community about their experiences as part of the campus community, as a measurement of the Institute's progress towards the goals set forth in its strategic plan. The Climate Assessment Task Force (CATF) was comprised of students, faculty, and staff, and was tasked with overseeing a survey development process to assess the present experiences, perceptions, and knowledge of our campus community members with respect to a culture of collegiality, close collaboration, global perspective, intercultural sensitivity and respect, thoughtful interaction among a community of scholars. What information is the survey looking for? The survey is designed to provide insight into what it's like to be a member of the Georgia Tech campus community. We want your honest reflections on the interactions you've had on campus, your experiences in classrooms and labs, schools and colleges, and workplace environments. You're not required to answer any questions you don't want to, and we've included some open-ended questions to allow you to share your experiences in your own words. How will my data be used? As the first survey administered under the 2020-2030 Institute Strategic Plan, the results of this survey will set new baseline data essential to advancing and forming Institute-level strategies over the next decade. It will also be analyzed compared to the results of the 2017-2018 surveys, to measure how much progress the Institute is making towards building a diverse community of learning, discovery, and creation in an inclusive and collaborative environment. Is my participation optional? Yes, participation is completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to complete the survey; however, we encourage everyone to participate. Our goal is to create a better Tech for all, and we can't identify areas of improvement without your help. Can't my email be used to track my responses? No. You will receive a link that you can use to access the survey; however, that link will only track whether someone has completed the survey or not. It will not be tied to any identifying information, and all responses are completely anonymous, even to the research team. How do I take the survey? On March 14, you will receive an email to your Georgia Tech email address inviting you to participate in the survey. This link is unique to your email address and should not be shared. The survey will be available to take through April 8. You may take the survey at any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from work or from home. Why do you want to know my race or gender? We ask for demographic information to help us understand what the experience is like for certain groups on campus. As we process the data, our researchers will look to identify patterns and/or trends among those with similar races, genders, or other backgrounds, and provide information to drive strategic change as needed. Who can I contact for more information? If you have questions about the survey process, contact the Office of Academic Effectiveness at oae@gatech.edu. What happens next? Once the survey window closes, the Office of Institutional Effectiveness and Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion will begin to synthesize the data and translate the results into reports that will be shared with everyone in the campus community. Once the results are released, the committee will host town halls to present the findings to the campus community and allow a dialogue about we can move forward together.
