In particular, every year millions of users in the U.S. utilize Google’s Download your data feature or delete some of their data using Google’s My Activity feature. These tools enable users to choose the specific types of data across Google’s services that they want to review, download, or delete, with requests processed automatically. In addition, users may exercise their rights under specific privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act by contacting Google.
