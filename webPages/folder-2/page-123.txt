Submitting a copyright removal request is a legal process. What to know before you submit a removal request Copyright exceptions: You need to consider whether copyright exceptions, such as fair use or fair dealing, apply to the content. If an exception applies, then the removal request would be invalid. Personal info: If a video is removed for copyright infringement, the name of the copyright owner will be visible on YouTube in place of the video. If you give us a valid legal alternative, such as the name of a company or authorized representative, we'll review and apply it if appropriate. The copyright owner name you enter will become part of the public record of your request. Learn more about the public record of your removal request. Your full legal name is required to complete a copyright removal request. It may be shared with the uploader of the video removed for copyright infringement. The primary email address from your removal request may be shared with the uploader of the video removed for copyright infringement. The uploader might get in touch with you to resolve their associated copyright strike. Your physical address and phone number will remain confidential unless requested as part of a lawsuit. If YouTube is required to share any information, we’ll notify you before doing so. Prevent copies: You can select the option to prevent copies of the videos you’re reporting from being reuploaded to YouTube. If you select this option, your email address and copyright owner name may be shared with the uploader of the videos prevented from upload. Scheduled requests: You can schedule removal requests to take effect after 7 days. Scheduled requests will notify the uploader and give them 7 days before the content gets removed. Non-video content: To submit a removal request for non-video content, such as channel icon images, follow the steps here. Our webform cannot process non-video removal requests.

What happens after you submit a removal request After you submit a removal request, YouTube reviews it to make sure it’s valid and includes all the required information to comply with the law. You’ll get an email when we’ve taken action on your request. If your request is missing information or if more detail is needed, be sure to respond to the email with the necessary information so we can process your request. Keep in mind that the video may remain on YouTube until we’ve received this information. For example, you may be asked to: Provide a more specific title for your copyrighted work Submit evidence that you’re authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner you’re representing Confirm that you’ve considered whether the video could be protected by copyright exceptions, such as fair use or fair dealing.
