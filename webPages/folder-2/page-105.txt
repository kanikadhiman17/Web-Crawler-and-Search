Every use and application of the YouTube brand must be approved through the form below. Fill out a Brand Request Form Using the YouTube Logo Below you’ll find downloadable versions of the logo: Full-Color Light Logo Full-Color Dark Logo Monochrome Logos Clear Space Clear space buffers the logo from images, text, or other graphics that compromise its impact and visibility. The more breathing room you give our logo, the greater the impact it can have. The clear space around the logo must be equal to or greater than the size of the triangle in the icon. Sizing We’ve optimized our logo for specific sizes. The YouTube Logo must be crystal clear and legible, whether it appears on a smartphone or the jumbo screen in an arena. The minimum height for digital media is 20 dp (20 px) The minimum height for print is 0.125 in (3.1 mm) Don't do this The YouTube Logo is a symbol people recognize, so it should never be altered. Don't Use the logo in a phrase or sentence. Full-color Logo The full-color logos pair our YouTube Red icon with Almost Black (#212121) or White (#FFFFFF) text. The triangle in the red icon must always be white. The Almost Black full-color logo can be shown on a White background or light imagery. The White full-color logo can be shown on an Almost Black background or dark imagery. Monochrome Logo If it's difficult to see the full-color logo over a specific color or image you can use a monochrome logo instead. In monochrome logos the icon is the same color as the wordmark (either Almost Black or White). The triangle in the icon is knocked out so the background shows through. Using the YouTube Icon Full-Color Icon Light Icon Dark Icon Our Icon The YouTube Logo Icon is a flexible mark that can act as a call to action or a shorter version of the YouTube Logo. If you don't have room to use the logo at minimum size with the required clear space, you should use the YouTube Icon instead. Clear Space Clear space buffers the logo icon from images, text, or other graphics that compromise its impact and visibility. The more breathing room you give our logo icon, the greater the impact it can have. The clear space around the logo icon must be equal to or greater than the size of the triangle within the icon. Sizing We’ve optimized our logo icon for specific sizes. The YouTube Logo Icon must be crystal clear and legible, whether it appears on a smartphone or the jumbo screen in an arena. The minimum height for digital media is 20 dp (20 px) The minimum height for print is 0.125 in (3.1 mm) Don't do this The YouTube Logo Icon should never be altered in any way. Don't Use colors other than YouTube Red, Almost Black, or White. Using the icon in social media The YouTube Icon can only be used in social media assets when it links to a YouTube channel. Important: The only time a Logo or Icon can be made a link is when the destination URL is a YouTube channel.

Do Don't Third party approvals You’re responsible for getting third-party approvals from relevant content owners for any content you upload to YouTube that doesn't belong to you. You must have appropriate third-party approval from relevant content owners if you show any content in promotional material. YouTube doesn't negotiate permissions on behalf of our partners. You must contact the image or video owner directly to secure appropriate permissions. By uploading to YouTube, you guarantee that you have the necessary rights to upload your video. YouTube reserves the right to remove any content from the site that may violate its Terms of Use or Community Guidelines. Terms of Use Community Guidelines Using the word “YouTuber” Guidelines for creators We love that so many creators like to call themselves YouTubers. We just ask that “YouTuber” or “Tuber” is only used when talking about a person creating and uploading original video or music content to YouTube. We also want to keep "YouTuber" casual. That way everyone can use it. So please don’t use “YouTuber” or “Tuber” in official names of things like video series, books, and programs, or register domains, channel names, or trademarks that include those words. This’ll help us protect the YouTube trademark for the whole creator community. Guidelines for advertisers “YouTuber” should only be used when referring to a person that creates and uploads original video or music content to YouTube. It’s not ok to call people that only upload content to other video platforms "YouTubers.” So that we can be sure "YouTuber" is only used in a casual way, we ask that third parties not use “YouTuber” in official names of things like video series, books, and programs, or seek to register domains, channel names, or trademarks that include those words. This’ll help protect the YouTube trademark for us and for the community. While “Tuber” can be used by YouTube creators informally, it should never be used by advertisers.
