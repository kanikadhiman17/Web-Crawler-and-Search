This year, the GRE will not be required for applications to the M.Arch, M.S. in Architecture, and MSUD programs. Apply Now! Our Graduate Programs The Master of Architecture program is the professional program in architecture leading to the NAAB-accredited M.Arch degree. The 2-year track accommodates students who hold a pre-professional degree in architecture and a 3.5 -year track is designed for students who hold an undergraduate degree in a field other than architecture. Licensure requirements include a professional degree, a period of practical training (internship), and successful completion of all of the sections of the Architect Registration Examination (ARE). Each state determines the specific requirements with regard to initial training, examination, and professional practice. Please visit www.NCARB.org for additional information. The M.S. in Architecture, the MSUD, and the Ph.D. programs are post-professional programs in advanced architectural studies and are oriented toward advanced practice, scholarship, and research.
