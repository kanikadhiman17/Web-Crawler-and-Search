The same set of standards is applied to all undergraduate applicants for admission to Georgia Tech, regardless of major. Since the applicant pool changes each year, so do the standards. Apply Now! Admissions Requirements Admission decisions are based on a combination of factors, including academic GPA, test scores (SAT I or ACT), leadership record, and personal statement. Undergraduate admission decisions are not made by the College of Design or the School of Architecture. A portfolio is not a requirement for admission to the undergraduate program in architecture at Georgia Tech. Visit the Office of Admissions Meet Our Undergraduate Ambassadors Our Undergraduate Ambassadors are faculty-nominated student representatives who embody the diversity, talent, and enthusiasm of our School.
