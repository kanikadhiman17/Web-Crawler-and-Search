Why Global Development? Global development is a field that seeks to directly address the critical challenges of advancing sustainability, protecting critical environmental resources, responding to climate change, reducing poverty and inequality, and improving the socio-economic well-being of citizens across the globe. With momentum around the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, Paris Climate Accords, and the U.N. New Urban Agenda, high-profile efforts of private foundations and international aid agencies and many innovations and new models emerging across sectors, the time is ripe for pursuing a career in Global Development. Practitioners in this vast field may work on issues ranging from urban infrastructure to global health to emerging market investment opportunities.
