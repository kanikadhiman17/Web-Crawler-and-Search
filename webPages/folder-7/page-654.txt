Allen Lecturer Academy of Medicine Lecturer News & Events Open Search Search Breadcrumb Home Computer Policy The School of Architecture requires all students enrolled in any degree program to bring to school a personal laptop powerful enough to support the demanding video and computational requirements necessary for coursework. This policy reflects the reality that students without an appropriately configured laptop will not be able to fully participate in the broad array of activities essential to design education in the 21st century. Students can purchase a PC or Mac, however, we strongly recommend you purchase a PC, as a Mac properly configured to run many design software programs is more costly and complicated. Laptops configured to the appropriate hardware specifications are available to order from the Georgia Tech Barnes and Noble in Tech Square. Other machines meeting the minimum requirements with the appropriate software are also acceptable. If you have recently purchased a laptop that does not meet the required specification, it is possible that you can upgrade certain components to bring your laptop up to the SoA specs.
