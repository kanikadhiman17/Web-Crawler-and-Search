Allen Lecturer Academy of Medicine Lecturer News & Events Open Search Search Breadcrumb Home Accreditation In the United States, most registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit professional degree programs in architecture offered by institutions with U.S. regional accreditation, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year term, an eight-year term with conditions, or a two-year term of continuing accreditation, or a three-year term of initial accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established education standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may require a non-accredited undergraduate degree in architecture for admission. However, the non-accredited degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Architecture offers the following NAAB-accredited degree programs: Master of Architecture, 3.5-year track (non-professional degree + 102 semester hours) Master of Architecture, 2-year track (preprofessional degree + 60 semester hours) Next accreditation visit for both programs: 2022 National Architectural Accrediting Board Home For more information about accreditation 2020 NAAB Conditions for Accreditation 2020 NAAB Procedures for Accreditation 2015 NAAB Procedures for Accreditation 2014 NAAB Conditions for Accreditation 2012 NAAB Procedures for Accreditation 2009 NAAB Conditions for Accreditation NAAB Documents 2014 NAAB Decision 2014 NAAB Visiting Team Report 2013 NAAB Annual Statistical Report 2013 NAAB Arch Program Report 2012 NAAB Annual Report 2012 NAAB Annual Report Statistical Data 2011 NAAB Annual Report 2011 NAAB Annual Report Statistical Data 2010 NAAB Annual Report 2010 NAAB Annual Report Statistical Data 2010 NAAB Special Program FE Report Decision 2010 NAAB Correspondence Re Special Focused Evaluation 2010 NAAB Special Program FE Report NCARB Architect Registration Examination Pass (ARE) Rates ARE is a practice-based exam founded on education and enhanced by experience.
