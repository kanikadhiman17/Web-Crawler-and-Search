Allen Lecturer Academy of Medicine Lecturer News & Events Open Search Search Breadcrumb Home Building Design Technology Building Design Technology Research in Building Design Technology at the Georgia Tech School of Architecture combines rigorous investigation with design interrogation. This discipline brings together students, researchers, and faculty focusing on solving the world’s most pressing challenges through interdisciplinarity. Architects, designers, engineers, building scientists, planners, and data analysts work together to address the biggest threat to life on earth: climate change. The work can be pursued at the level of basic science at the material level, all the way to large-scale, real-world applications at the city scale, all scrutinized for excellence in economic, societal, and energy performance. Our goal is to pioneer design-based technologies through various fields including data analytics, building performance simulation, structural analysis, and material innovations, among others.
