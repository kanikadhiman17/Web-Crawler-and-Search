Allen Lecturer Academy of Medicine Lecturer News & Events Open Search Search Breadcrumb Home Graduate Assistantships In support of its missions in teaching and research, the School of Architecture awards a limited number of graduate assistantships (GRA, GTA, and GSA positions) each year to students enrolled in the School of Architecture. The assistantships require an average of 15 hours of service each week and provide a stipend and graduate tuition waiver each semester (not inclusive of any additional tuition costs and mandatory student fees which are paid by the student). These assistantships are awarded each semester based upon budget availability, the need of faculty, and student qualifications. New applicants or continuing students should indicate their interest in and qualifications for these positions in a separate letter to be included in their application package or submitted to the Academic Advisor. There is no other application process for graduate assistantships. The following research and teaching assistantships are administered directly by the School of Architecture. Sponsored Graduate Research Assistantships Sponsored research assistantships are available on a limited basis each year to students who typically have spent at least one year in any of the School of Architecture graduate programs. The availability of these awards is dependent on the nature and amount of externally-sponsored research activity in the College of Design and the background and experience of the applicants relative to the research being conducted. Graduate Teaching Assistantships A limited number of teaching assistantships are awarded to students who typically have spent at least one year in one of the School of Architecture graduate programs. The positions that occasionally become available include architectural history, architectural technology, design computing, environmental systems, structures, and urban design. It is essential that the applicants for these positions have outstanding qualifications from previous academic and/or professional experience. Questions?
