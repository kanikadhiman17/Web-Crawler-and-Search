The newly renovated facility was more than 10 years in the making and was designed to meet the needs of our growing and diverse student population. A place for students to grow and develop as leaders. And how fitting that it’s named after one of the greatest student leaders in American history: John Lewis, who as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee became an icon of the Civil Rights movement. My most sincere appreciation to the donors who created a student leadership development endowment in honor of John Lewis and supported the naming of the student center: Southern Company, and alumni Richard “Dick” Bergmark (IM 1975), Steve Denning (IM 1970), Robert Dixon (EE 1977) and Beth Cabrera (MS PSY 1993, Ph.D. PSY 1995). By dedicating our new student center to John Lewis, we aim to create a constant reminder of his legacy, and to inspire and motivate generations of current and future students to bring change to our society for the better.
