The new sustainability initiative stems in part from Tech’s affiliation with the University Global Coalition (UGC), which President Cabrera chairs and helped found. Established in 2019, the UGC comprises a group of higher education leaders from across the globe who work together to advance the SDGs through education, research, service, and campus operations. Locally, Georgia Tech is also affiliated with RCE Greater Atlanta, a UN-designated Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development. 2022 SDG Action and Awareness Week President Cabrera encourages the Institute community to participate in SDG Action and Awareness Week this Feb. 28 – March 4 for five days of virtual SDG-focused events.  SDG Action and Awareness Week invites universities around the world to host events that increase awareness of the SDGs, showcase the work they’re doing, and encourage action. Georgia Tech will host a variety of events throughout the week and encourages partners around campus to organize and host their own SDG-focused events (such as a workshop, service project, or conversation panel) to help showcase the many ways Georgia Tech is making progress toward achieving these global goals on a local level.  Join 2022 SDG Action & Awareness Week Events Explore Resources from the University Global Coalition United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 17 Rooms at Georgia Tech: Recommended Actions In October 2020, Georgia Tech hosted a virtual version of the 17 Rooms activation event concept developed by The Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation.
