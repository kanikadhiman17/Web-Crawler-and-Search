The Student Right-To-Know (SRTK) and Campus Security Act, passed by Congress in 1990, updated the HEA to require that institutions receiving Title IV funding disclose additional information; specifically, campuses must calculate completion or graduation rates of certificate or degree-seeking, full-time students entering the institution. In addition, institutions that receive Title IV funding and award athletic aid must share student success outcomes for all students and for student-athletes by race/ethnicity, by gender, and by sport, as well as the average completion/graduation rates for the four most recent years, to parents, coaches, and potential student-athletes.
