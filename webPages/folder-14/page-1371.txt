OK Home About the SSC Work at SSC Address and Directions SSC Service Catalog OneUSG Connect Supplier Maintenance USG Status Page Financial Aid Services Contact SSC Announcements Shared Services Center (SSC) is the University System of Georgia’s (USG) central organization providing functional and transactional support, primarily in the area of HR and Payroll, to streamline processes across our 26 institutions, to monitor and manage compliance risk and to allow our institutions to redirect their focus to more student- driven activities. The SSC partners with the University System Office, Information Technology Services and USG institutions to operationalize policy, compliance requirements, and legislation through updating and configuring supported applications and defining processes for institutions to follow. The Shared Services Initiative aligns with the third priority of the Chancellor’s priorities for the USG, “Be more efficient”, regarding finding “opportunities to be more efficient and make college more accessible.” Specifically, the SSC was created to centralize and standardize certain administrative functions. The USG continues to study additional opportunities to expand shared and centralized administrative services.
