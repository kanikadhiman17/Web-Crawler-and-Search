We ensure Tech’s compliance with all federal and state laws regarding Equal Opportunity, Title IX, and The Americans with Disabilities Act. We oversee the six Georgia Tech ADVANCE Professorships, which enhance gender diversity in the faculty. We also direct the Center for the Study of Women, Science, and Technology (WST). Our office addresses issues of student diversity and inclusion via the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion -- which houses OMED: Educational Services, the Office of Hispanic Initiatives, and WST -- for women and historically underserved and underrepresented populations.
