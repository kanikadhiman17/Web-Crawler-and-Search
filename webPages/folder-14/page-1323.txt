Comprehensive Administrative Review Redesigned General Education Mental Health Initiative Strategic Plan 2024 UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF GEORGIA Comprehensive Administrative Review Home Overview White Paper Phase Assignments Steering Committee Members Institution Specific Information Frequently Asked Questions General Questions News Releases Contact Us University System of Georgia (USG) Chancellor Steve Wrigley announced a Comprehensive Administrative Review at the April 2017 Board meeting. This is a systemwide initiative focused on improving administration through creating efficiencies, streamlining processes and finding ways to be more effective with USG resources. Throughout the Comprehensive Administrative Review, a steering committee composed of representatives from USG institutions led the effort. They took an in-depth look at all non-faculty administrative functions across the University System. Core faculty activities, such as teaching and research, were exempt from the review. The initiative is currently in the last phase of a two-phase process. The University System Office and the University of West Georgia were the first organizations reviewed. They were followed by Georgia Institute of Technology, East Georgia State College, Kennesaw State University, South Georgia State College and the University of North Georgia. The second phase began in the spring of 2018 and included the remaining USG institutions. This website is designed to continue fostering a transparent process and to provide general information about the Comprehensive Administrative Review.
