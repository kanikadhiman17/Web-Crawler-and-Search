As such, we are dedicated to creating a community of leaders who will guide Tech in the 21st century—an institution committed to inclusive leadership, teaching, scholarship, and innovation. One of the major findings from Georgia Tech’s Climate Assessment Survey in 2012 that has improved over time was an expressed desire for targeted professional and career development efforts for staff women. With the support of the Office of the President, Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion began offering the Leading Women@Tech program in 2016 to engage women leaders and administrators at Georgia Tech in doing just that. The program has now served five cohorts of accomplished women leaders many of whom have achieved greater success due to habits they began practicing or honed because of participation in this program. Vision In alignment with the Institute’s Strategic and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) plans and specifically Goal 2 of the DEI Plan, “Recruit, Retain, and Develop a Diverse Community of Students, Faculty, and Staff”, we will develop people leaders who consistently demonstrate self-awareness, emotional intelligence, cultural competency, inclusiveness, and a responsibility, for a culture of inclusive innovation and excellence. This initiative acknowledges excellence and supports for employees who identify as women and who may also identify as faculty and staff of color. Primary Responsibilities Strengthen leadership ability, enhance personal and professional growth, and support overall career development of the participants. Create opportunities for women leaders to network, build community, and advance a culture of inclusive excellence. Program Activities Monthly workshops and skill-building sessions in the areas of self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and storytelling. Leadership and life coaching is an option available to those who complete skill-building all of sessions with their cohort. Coaching deepens individual growth and empowers participants to act on their career and life goals.
