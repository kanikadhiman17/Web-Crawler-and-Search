UPDATE Due to staffing changes, the Impact Living-Learning Community will not be available in Fall 2022. We look forward to bringing in a new cohort of students in Fall 2023. Impact Living-Learning Community (LLC) is an initiative open to all first-year students and majors who are interested in exploring issues of diversity, social good, and sustainability. As the most diverse living-learning community on-campus, we identify as a safe space and environment where students can be their authentic selves. Through fun field trips/outings and more, Impact puts students directly in the Atlanta community, rich with opportunities for engagement. Focusing on partnerships and professional development also sets our program apart. Impact Financial Support If you are interested in Impact but need financial support or would like us to help you during the semester, don't hesitate to apply and just let us know. We will definitely be able to provide you with specific resources and help with your LLC fee!
