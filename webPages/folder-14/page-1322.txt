At its November 2011 meeting the Board of Regents adopted six “Principles for Consolidation” that were then used by University System staff to assess the potential for other campus consolidations. Additional consolidations have since been recommended and approved. The potential for additional consolidations remains an active policy. This website is designed to help foster that transparent process. In addition to general information about the consolidations, there are individual pages for each specific consolidation.
