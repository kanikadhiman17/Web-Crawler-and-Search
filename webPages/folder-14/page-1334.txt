Such documents include, but are not limited to, news releases, presentations, promotional or marketing materials, ads, websites, emails, and other messages designed to represent the USG and its programs. It is the responsibility of each individual who develops correspondence or promotional materials for USG divisions, departments, programs, centers and units to adhere to these guidelines to ensure that a harmonious message and identity are communicated to the USG’s varied audiences. This includes materials for programs sponsored solely by the USG or for which the USG may be a co-sponsor with another institution or organization. USG Communications maintains the system’s visual and editorial standards. When considering or developing publications, please contact USG Communications early in the process to ensure that your publication is in compliance with these standards and, therefore, helps build the USG brand. If you need guidance/have questions related to USG’s Branding Standards, please contact graphics@usg.edu. All publications prepared for distribution by USG departments, divisions and affiliates to external audiences must be reviewed by USG Communications prior to production in final form to ensure their compliance with the brand standards outlined here.
