We thrive on diversity. We see diversity of backgrounds and perspectives as essential to learning, discovery, and creation. We strive to remove barriers to access and success, and to build an inclusive community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and contribute to our mission. - Georgia Tech Strategic Plan (2020) At Tech, we embrace and leverage diversity in all its manifestations. We are proud that we are one of the most diverse universities in the world, with students who represent every state in the nation and more than 100 countries. In the years ahead, our goal is to continue to build a campus culture of collegiality, close collaboration, global perspective, intercultural sensitivity, respect, and thoughtful interaction among a diverse community of students, employees, and alumni. We realize that, in order to achieve our vision for Georgia Tech as a leader in influencing the major technological, social, and policy decisions in the twenty-first century, we must recruit and retain faculty, staff, and students from a wide array of backgrounds, perspectives, interests, and talents. In doing so, we will create a community that exemplifies the best in all of us---our intellectual pursuits, our diversity of thought, and our personal integrity. Our mission to achieve inclusive excellence means unleashing the full potential of Tech's human capacity to create a better, sustainable future for us all. You are invited to join us on the journey of creating and sustaining a future that builds upon the talents of all members of our community in addressing the major challenges of this and future generations.
