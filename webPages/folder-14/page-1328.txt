OK Academic Common Market University System of Georgia Home Procedures & Criteria Application Regional Contract Program Proof of Georgia Residency Frequently Asked Questions The Academic Common Market (ACM), which is administered by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), allows for Georgia residents who are enrolled in specific programs at out-of-state institutions to be charged only the applicable in-state tuition by the institution in which the student is enrolled. Only programs that are listed in the Georgia Academic Common Market Inventory (see “Search for Qualifying Georgia Academic Common Market Programs,” below) are eligible for participation in the Georgia Academic Common Market. Georgia is not accepting requests to add new programs to its Academic Common Market Inventory. Eligible programs are programs that were identified as being at least 51 percent different in curricular content than programs offered in Georgia. Participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia (Florida and Texas participate only at the graduate level). Search for Qualifying Georgia Academic Common Market Programs Program Highlights: Approved programs must be designed to culminate in the conferral of a baccalaureate, masters, specialist, or doctoral degree, and the institution must be able to classify the participant as degree-seeking. All other degrees or awards are not eligible for inclusion in the ACM. Additionally, some institutions and states may impose additional acceptance requirements such as full-time enrollment status. Academic Common Market Disclaimer As the coordinating agency for the state of Georgia’s participation in the SREB’s Academic Common Market (ACM), the University System of Georgia (USG) reserves the right at its discretion and at any time to remove academic programs offered by Georgia institutions from the ACM and/or remove access to academic programs at out-of-state institutions offered to Georgians through the ACM. Students who begin studies at one institution with the intent to transfer to an ACM institution/program are not guaranteed ACM access if the respective program is removed from the ACM during their time at the institution of origin.
