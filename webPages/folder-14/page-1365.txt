Our specific areas of focus include: Accreditation Support Provides a spectrum of accreditation reaffirmation resources for USG institutions as it pertains to BOR bylaws, policies, procedures and evaluations; evidence of the BOR’s policy making and governance role and compliance with the requirements specified by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). Athletics Board policy requires review of institutional intercollegiate athletic programs for financial and program soundness. Comprehensive Administrative Review The Comprehensive Administrative Review is a system-wide initiative focused on improving administration through creating efficiencies, streamlining processes and finding ways to be more effective with USG resources. Enterprise Risk Management Risk is everywhere - however, properly managed risk is an organizational tool that allows USG institutions to pursue excellence while mitigating the downside of the five types of Enterprise Risk.
