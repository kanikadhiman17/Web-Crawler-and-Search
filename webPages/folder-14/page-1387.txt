We will recruit, develop, retain, and engage a heterogeneous cadre of students, faculty, and staff with a wide variety of backgrounds, perspectives, interests, and talents, creating a campus community that exemplifies the best in all of us—in our intellectual pursuits, our diversity of thought, our personal integrity, and, our inclusive excellence." Our students and faculty will collaborate not only with each other, but also with learners across the globe, addressing problems of regional, national, and global significance. Inclusive excellence includes all features, ideas, processes and challenges connected to diversity or individual differences and pushes the discussion and call to action further to include making institutional change. Inclusive excellence is a strategic framework, encouraging active examination and evaluation of Tech’s practices and policies. This tactical assessment will allow the Institution to set goals with measurable outcomes. Our success is dependent on how well we value, engage and include the rich diversity of students, staff, faculty, administrators, and alumni constituents, and all the valuable social dimensions that they bring to the campus. More than a short-term project or single office initiative, inclusive excellence is a comprehensive approach that requires a fundamental transformation of the institution by embedding and practicing inclusive excellence in every effort, aspect, and level of our Institution. The goal is to make inclusive excellence a habit that is implemented and practiced consistently. To practice inclusiveness is excellence. Archie W.
