Whether hosting a live charity event, a town hall or a press conference about breaking news, YouTube Live and Premieres allow Creators to bring viewers together in real-time to learn, discuss and to form new social communities. YouTube Live is an easy way for Creators to reach their community in real time. Whether streaming an event, teaching a class, or hosting a workshop, YouTube has tools that will help manage live streams and interact with viewers in real time. Creators can live stream on YouTube via webcam, mobile, and encoder streaming. Webcam and mobile are considered great options for beginners and allow Creators to go live quickly. Encoder streaming is ideal for more advanced live streams such as: sharing creator’s screen or broadcast your gameplay, connecting to external audio and video hardware, and managing an advanced live stream production (like multiple cameras and microphones).

YouTube offers live chat moderation tools to help prevent harassment and make everyone feel safe. Some of these tools include: assigning moderators, blocking words list, holding inappropriate chats for review, slow mode, and turning off Live Chat. Before starting a live stream or debuting a Premiere on YouTube, we encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with our moderation tools and Community Guidelines to keep live chat positive for viewers. For Creators to monetize their live stream or Premiere, their channel needs to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Creators have several ways to earn money from live streams and Premieres: Ads, Super Chat and Super Stickers, and Channel Memberships. *Feature availability varies by country and we are working to expand to more countries.
