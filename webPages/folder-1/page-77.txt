February 25, 2022: In light of the war in Ukraine, we are pausing YouTube‚Äôs monetization of Russian Federation state-funded media channels. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary.

It also allows revenue sharing from ads being served on your content. Learn more about the features, eligibility criteria, and application details in this article. Want to apply to YPP, but need help building an audience first? Check out our tips to establish your fanbase, and our tips for the YouTube Partner Program. What you need to join Follow the YouTube channel monetization policies. These are a collection of policies and guidelines that allow you to monetize on YouTube, and compliance with them is required when you accept a partner agreement with YouTube. Live in a country/region where the YouTube Partner Program is available. Have no active Community Guidelines strikes on your channel. Make sure 2-Step Verification is turned on for your Google Account. Have one active AdSense account that you‚Äôll link to your channel, or be ready to set one up in YouTube Studio if you don‚Äôt already have one (only create a new AdSense account in YouTube Studio ‚Äì learn more). How you can become eligible üéâ As of October 2022, eligible Shorts views for creators not in YPP count towards eligibility for YPP! Once you understand what you need to join, your channel can become eligible for YPP with either Shorts or long-form video. If you‚Äôd like us to notify you when you‚Äôre eligible, click Notify me when I‚Äôm eligible in the Earn area of YouTube Studio. You‚Äôll get an email once you‚Äôve met either of the below eligibility thresholds. 1. Get 1,000 subscribers with 4,000 valid public watch hours in the last 12 months, or 2. Get 1,000 subscribers with 10 million valid public Shorts views in the last 90 days. Keep in mind that any public watch hours from Shorts views in the Shorts Feed won‚Äôt count towards the 4,000 public watch hours threshold. More on eligibility thresholds These thresholds help us make a more informed decision about whether your channel meets our policies and guidelines. Once you apply, your channel will go through a standard review process to see whether your channel meets our policies and guidelines. If it meets our policies and guidelines, we‚Äôll accept your channel into YPP. Keep in mind we continuously check channels in YPP to make sure they continue to meet our policies and guidelines over time. Where to apply Once you have what you need and your channel is eligible to apply, sign up for YPP from either a desktop computer or a mobile device: Sign in to YouTube In the top right, click your profile picture YouTube Studio In the left menu, click Earn Click Start to review and Accept Base terms Click Start to set up an AdSense account, or link an existing active one Once done, you‚Äôll see In Progress in the Get Reviewed step, which means we have your application! How we review your application Once you accept YPP terms and link an active AdSense account, your channel will automatically be put in a review queue. Our automated systems and human reviewers will review your channel as a whole to make sure your channel follows all of our policies and guidelines. Check back in the Earn section of YouTube Studio anytime to see the status of your application. We‚Äôll get back to you with a decision once your channel is reviewed (typically in about 1 month). Keep in mind delays are possible due to higher-than-usual application volumes, system issues, or resource limitations. All YPP applications are serviced in the order they‚Äôre received by us. Sometimes channels require multiple reviews, especially when several reviewers disagree on your channel‚Äôs suitability for YPP. This may increase the time required for a decision to be made. If your application wasn‚Äôt successful, don‚Äôt worry - keep uploading original content and you‚Äôll be able to try again after a 30-day period. Our reviewers likely found that a significant portion of your channel doesn‚Äôt currently follow our policies and guidelines, so be sure to review those against your channel‚Äôs overall content and adjust your channel before re-applying. Learn more about steps you can take to strengthen your application for next time. Choose how to earn and get paid Once you‚Äôre in YPP, get started in YouTube Studio with Watch Page Ads, Shorts Feed Ads, Memberships, Supers, Shopping, and more. To turn on monetization features, you‚Äôll need to review and accept the relevant module terms. Learn more about the modules and their options here. After choosing how you want to monetize, you‚Äôll be able to manage ad preferences, turn on monetization for your uploads, and more. Here‚Äôs a list of FAQs that we get from creators who have just joined YPP. Getting paid Visit our Help Center for an easier understanding of your earnings as a YouTube partner, learn all about AdSense (Google‚Äôs program that lets creators in YPP get paid), and troubleshoot common payment issues. Stay active to keep making money As the YouTube Partner Program continues to grow, it's important to maintain a healthy, active ecosystem of channels.

What do ‚Äúvalid public watch hours‚Äù and "valid public Shorts views" mean? Valid public watch hours What counts as a valid public watch hour: Watch hours gained from long-form videos you‚Äôve set public Watch hours gained through the following types of video don‚Äôt count towards YPP thresholds: Private videos Unlisted videos Deleted videos Ad campaigns YouTube Shorts Livestreams that are unlisted, deleted, or not converted to VOD (video on demand) Valid public Shorts views What counts as a valid public Short view: Views of Shorts that you‚Äôve set public that appear in the Shorts Feed Keep in mind that any public watch hours from Shorts views in the Shorts Feed don‚Äôt count towards the 4,000 public watch hours threshold. For info about Shorts view eligibility with regards to how we calculate payments, see our YouTube Shorts monetization policies. If I meet the threshold, do I automatically get into YPP? No. Every channel that meets the threshold will go through a standard review process. Our team will review your channel as a whole to check whether your channel meets our YouTube channel monetization policies. Your channel also must not have any active Community Guidelines strikes in order to apply. Channels that follow our policies and guidelines can monetize. What happens if my counts drop below the threshold after I apply? We‚Äôll send your channel for review once you meet our valid public watch hours and subscriber threshold. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if your subscriber or watch hour counts drop below the threshold while waiting for review. If you‚Äôve met the threshold and applied for YPP, we‚Äôll still review your channel for YPP suitability. If a channel is inactive and has not uploaded or posted Community posts for 6 months or more, YouTube reserves the right to remove its monetization. Channels will lose monetization when they violate any of the YouTube channel monetization policies. This loss of monetization will happen regardless of their watch hours and subscriber count. I‚Äôm no longer in YPP (or I was never in the program) and I‚Äôm seeing ads on my videos. Am I earning revenue from those ads? YouTube can serve ads on all content on the platform. If you were previously a member of YPP (and currently are not in the program), you may still see ads being served on your content. In this case, you don't get a share of the revenue. If you rejoin YPP in the future, you can get a share of the revenue from ads served on your content after you rejoin. In that case, when reapplying for YPP, make sure that your channel meets the eligibility criteria outlined on this page. Was this helpful? How can we improve it?
