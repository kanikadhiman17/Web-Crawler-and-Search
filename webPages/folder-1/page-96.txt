Creator basics: how to set up and customize your channel There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We offer up different formats and functionalities, giving you the flexibility to create everything from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60 seconds or less, to longer form videos. No matter what you’re creating, you’ll need to start by creating a YouTube Channel. First you need to sign into YouTube using a Google Account. Once you’re signed in, click ‘Create Account’, and choose whether it’s for you or for your business. You can then create a YouTube channel on your account, upload videos, leave comments, and create Shorts and playlists. Next, you’ll want to upload your videos! Uploading is easy. You just sign into your YouTube account and then click on the “Create” icon. If you’re planning to upload a longer form video, select “upload video” and then choose your desired video file - you can upload 15 files at a time! If you’d like to upload a YouTube Short, you’ll need to be signed into YouTube mobile, where you’ll tap ‘Create’ and then ‘Create a Short’. From here you can either upload a video from your camera roll or create using our suite of lightweight tools. Help your videos stand out & keep viewers watching Growing your channel is all about creating videos viewers want to watch and accurately presenting them to the audience. When doing so, here’s a few tips to keep in mind. With each video, think carefully about the title, description, and thumbnail you plan to use - these should all accurately reflect your content and let viewers know what they can expect from the video. If you’re a Shorts creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of your content can grab viewers scrolling through the video feed! Once you’ve got viewers watching, you can redirect their attention via hashtags, playlists, cards, end screens, and more. Navigating YouTube Studio YouTube Studio is your home base for posting videos and making edits to your channel. To update your channel’s basic info like name, profile picture, and banner, just log in and tap ‘Customisation’ to see your options. You can also make changes to your channel using the Studio Mobile app. You can tap ‘Your Channel’ and then ‘Edit Channel’ to update and edit how your channel looks to your viewers.

On YouTube, you can use tools like cards, end screens, Stories, and Community Posts to drive viewers to a specific piece of content! Off-platform, think about promoting your videos on your socials and relevant communities, podcasts, or platforms that align with your content and your intended audience. Read more about promoting your videos How YouTube recommends videos using "the algorithm" Our search and discovery systems are built to find videos that match viewers’ individual interests. We recommend videos based on things such as: what your audience watches and doesn’t watch, how much time they spend watching, what they like and dislike, if they mark a video as ‘not interested’, and on satisfaction surveys. So, rather than trying trying to find a secret code to these systems, focus instead on making videos that you think will resonate with your audience. A great tool here is YouTube Analytics, which provides data that can help you understand how your existing content is performing and provide insights for future videos! 01 How do I start creating on YouTube?
