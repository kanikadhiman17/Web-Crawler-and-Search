We believe technology should improve life, not distract from it, so we’re committed to giving you the resources you need to develop a healthy relationship with technology. We have built a set of tools to provide a better understanding of how you spend time on YouTube, so you can make informed decisions about how you want YouTube to best fit into your life. Digital wellbeing tools Autoplay What are a few examples of digital wellbeing tools? A few examples include our “time watched profile”, “take a break reminder”, “bedtime reminder", and the ability to “set a timer”. They are designed to help everyone better understand their YouTube usage, disconnect when needed, and create healthy habits for the entire family.

Once you start watching a video, we offer a list of other videos for you to watch next via the “autoplay” feature. It is our priority to provide you with the tools you need to control your experience on YouTube, so you can turn off the “autoplay” feature at any time using the toggle option available on the watch page.
