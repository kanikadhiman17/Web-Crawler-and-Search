The US-EU conference is planned to be in-person during FIU’s spring break when the campus population diminishes significantly; many conference activities will be outdoors and extraordinary effort will be taken to provide all attendees a safe and healthy conference experience. A virtual session of remotely-delivered paper and poster presentations will be staged May 23, 2022 for authors who were unable to attend the in-person conference at FIU.

The general aim of our biennial joint conferences is to invite and exchange ideas, research, strategies, reflections and debates on architecture and the built environment. The following description and topics below serve to frame this years focus on the Resilient City. RESILIENT CITY: Physical, Social, and Economic Perspectives The challenge of creating cities and landscapes resilient to social and environmental change lies at the core of critical research in the design disciplines. These challenges are the consequences, direct and indirect, of a warming planet with nearly 8 billion diverse inhabitants, an increasing number of whom reside in coastal (mega)cities amid conditions of growing inequity, vulnerability and disparities in public health. Around the globe and at a range of scales, the professions and disciplines involved in the design and development of environmental and urban systems, are harnessing technologies and practices, both well-established and at the cutting edge, to play a significant role in formulating responses to such ecosystem stressors. Through its focus on urban resilience, the 2022 ARCC-EAAE International Conference addresses the multiplicity of ways in which new design pedagogies, research, and innovation, carried out across our disciplines and professions, empower us to educate a new generation of built environment designers, and to meet the strategic imperatives of this historical moment.
