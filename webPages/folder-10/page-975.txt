The Architecture Department faculty’s core purpose is to prepare new practitioners in the design of the built environment, and for the path to architectural licensure. It seeks ways by which humanity can inhabit this planet in a sustainably healthy way. It does so primarily through its NAAB accredited Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) program and its soon to be accredited Interior Architecture program. The School of Architecture & Design is dedicated to inclusive, diverse and equitable learning, teaching and working environments for its community of students, staff and faculty, and actively encourages applications from members of underrepresented groups in higher education. > SUSTAINABILITY The field of sustainable design has become increasingly central to architectural and design education as the effects of climate change, the conservation of limited resources, and the social and economic impacts of energy consumption in buildings become more severe. Architects are now expected to incorporate performance-driven knowledge and conduct research in this critical area of practice as a matter of course. For this reason, it is vital that the professional curricula and graduate programs reflect the most current research techniques and methods of application within the Department of Architecture.

The increase in the use of evidence-based research and design methods is transforming the ways architects and designers are educated to meet the technical and regulatory expectations of building clients and users. This position will be central in implementing coursework in this area of knowledge in the professional and graduate curricula, fostering funded research and industry partnerships in healthcare environments, and coordinating existing and future programs and facilities in the School’s Institute for Health & Wellness Design.
