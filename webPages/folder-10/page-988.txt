The DBL is a leading research center developing standards supporting the development and exchange of building information modeling (BIM) data. Over the past decade, the DBL has led research in creating interoperability standards for a diverse set of construction industry consortia, including BuildingSmart, the American Institute of Steel Construction, The Precast Concrete Institute, and the Masonry Institute of America. The DBL’s long-standing expertise in AEC data interoperability and exchange processes provides the background for developing the next generation of web-connected paradigms for the AEC industry. Traditional file-based design engineering and construction software are increasingly going online. Today’s standards for building information are being refactored to take advantage of emerging web-based information standards that can enable a host of next-generation advancements in the industry.
