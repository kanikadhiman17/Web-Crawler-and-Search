ENQ is committed to open sharing and persistent access to knowledge as a key element in building and maintaining an architectural research community. Open Access – ENQ is free from all access barriers, allowing for the widest possible global dissemination of your work, leading to more citations. We are a member of the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) which is committed to journal visibility, accessibility and reputation. Visibility – all articles published in ENQ are automatically harvested by WorldCat, Avery Index, Scopus and Google Scholar. We are an OAI compliant system to ensure compatibility between metadata and harvesting services. Our indexing partners ensure author articles are highly visible and connected to related research. Academic Integrity - ENQ does not charge authors to publish articles. The journal is funded by the Architectural Research Centers Consortium which allows the editorial and publication process to focus on academic integrity, quality, relevancy and significance independant to revenue sources. Stability - ENQ is a member of CrossREF to provide our authors with stable DOI management for their articles and to increase visibility and citation. Engaged Editorial Process - ENQ's article review process consists of several editorial passes and peer reviews which help authors develop their work. This also makes ENQ a positive environment for early career academics and Ph.D. candidates, supporting the ARCC's focus on research culture.

She cites “An exclusionary definition” centered only on aesthetics and disciplinary autonomy that “leaves the choice to become an architect to those few people who wish to practice a ‘gentlemanly’ art….” as a key challenge. Sutton, Harriet Harriss, and others have argued that the central emphasis on aesthetics and celebration of the “Howard Roark” model of genius has disenfranchised students with broader interests. As Kathryn Anthony’s research has demonstrated, cultural traditions such as final reviews, often undermine rather than contribute to learning outcomes. These cultural norms have created a self-perpetuating cycle: design programs often marginalize those students with broader interests, with social agendas or research interests by celebrating the primacy of the design studio. While architectural and design curricula have evolved in the intervening decades, the culture of the design schools, teaching methods, and role models remain far too similar to the one described by Sutton and Anthony decades ago. By contrast, this special issue seeks to document, describe and critique evidence-based teaching and learning strategies for creating more inclusive design pedagogies and practices.
