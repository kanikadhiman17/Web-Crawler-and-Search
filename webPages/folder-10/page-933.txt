If you struggle to challenge negative messages, handle stress, or maintain healthy habits and routines when faced with difficult situations, this is the group for you. This group is not intended to be or to replace group therapy. It can be a useful complement to therapy and it also stands alone as a resource for anyone who wants to learn crucial resilience skills.
