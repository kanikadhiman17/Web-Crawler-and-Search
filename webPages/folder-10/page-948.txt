The Architectural Research Centers Consortium (ARCC) and the College of Architecture at TTU invites researchers, designers, educators, and students to submit their proposals and join the ARCC annual conference on the theme “The Research-Design Interface”. CALL FOR ABSTRACTS TOPIC AREAS SUBMISSION DEADLINES + TEMPLATES WORKSHOPS LOCAL VENUE + ACCOMMODATIONS REGISTRATION GRADUATE STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP DESIGN LEADERSHIP ALLIANCE MUSEUMS + CULTURE NEIGHBORHOODS + FOOD The Research-Design Interface Over the past two decades architectural practice has been called on to be more ‘responsible’. This is perhaps due to global realities such as climate changes, social disparities, health inequalities, etc. on one hand, and emerging technology such as digital modeling, 3D printing, robotics, machine learning and so on, on the other that offer precise design and analysis opportunities. On these are added a new approach called ‘Evidence Based Design’, understood as design decision making with an informed client using the best available research evidence with the goal of improving outcomes and continuous monitoring for subsequent decision-making. These conditions call for a radical transformation in design thinking where the ability to interact with technical knowledge and scientific evidence becomes necessary. As research becomes accepted as an integral part of design culture, the relationships between research results and practice applications – indeed that between researchers and designers — become paramount. While considerable attention has been given to the research component, the needs of the change agent – the designer– has been less adequately addressed. This conference seeks to bring together researchers who explore new ideas and answer relevant questions, design professionals who understand and implement them, and organizational clients and user groups. We hope to focus on the intersection — the ‘sharp edge’ where research and design intersect and hope to create a set of ideas regarding the ‘research-design interaction’, the middle and often misunderstood ground between the mindsets of the researcher and the designer.
