Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes IAM Client Applications Why put (non-IAM) Service documentation in IAM’s wiki With hundreds of applications using IAM Services, we’re using this wiki folder to collect specifics of what these applications are and how they use IAM services. This is a true wiki where application owners are able to follow these (forthcoming) directions to document their own applications. Our goal is to not duplicate Service Catalog pages, but instead to supplement those pages with technical details of IAM integration. Our plans are to use these wiki pages within IAT and Passport to show Service-specific information for users and accounts. Listing Passport IAT Documentation Details Our documentation template should include the following areas: Service Name Service description (short). Full information should be available as an external link (below) ManagedBy Department (what department runs the service) ManagedBy Group (what group (within the above department) runs the service) Available To (who is eligible) Automatically set up for (who should expect to automatically get access) Identity type: Person or Account Service Web Page (url to Service Catalog or another page with details on service) Request URL (What to click to request service) Incident Process: How to complain? Type: FootPrints Area, Email, ServiceNow, Text, URL Authorizing Information (perhaps multiple of them) Type: GTED Entitlement, MAGE Category, GTED Filter, GTAD Group String Meaning (optional) Other GTED Information Used Type: GTED Attribute, GTED Entitlement, GTED Entitlement Pattern, MAGE Category, GTED Filter, GTAD Group String Meaning/Use Advanced? (hidden by default) Authentication Type: GTED/LDAP, GTAD, CAS, Shibboleth, Kerberos IAM Data Feed Information: Which and how are GTED/LDAP, GTAD, CAS, Shibboleth, Data Warehouse, BuzzApi used to get Identity Information?
