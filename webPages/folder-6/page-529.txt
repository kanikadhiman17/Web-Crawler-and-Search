Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes Test Identities If you need temporary use of a test identity, send email to iam-support@oit.gatech.edu requesting the number of test IDs you need (bearing in mind that we have only a very small pool of these identities) and for how long. These identities are blanked every day at midnight or on whatever schedule is noted under “Blank Frequency,” at which point they have only a GTID, PIDM, and associated name. What you do with them is your business and your responsibility. DO NOT, without permission, use an ID assigned for use by someone else. Use the email link above to request your own. Banner is constantly cleaning itself of former people and, of course, people apply and matriculate to GT. So to make sure a GTID is available for testing, please do the following before using an ID that has been assigned to you: GTID=900005475
