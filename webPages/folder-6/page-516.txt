Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes DUO FAQ When are people required to use Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA) when they’re joining Georgia Tech? The timing of Duo 2FA requirements is different for Employees and Credit Students. Note: Student-Employees follow the more-stringent, employee requirements. Employees are required to use Duo 2FA as soon as their GT Accounts are created, typically on or before their first day of work. Credit-Students are required to use Duo 2FA during the third week of their first semester of classes. In other words, people applying to attend Georgia Tech are not required to use Duo 2FA during the application process, FASET events, initial course registration, or the first weeks of classes. However, after a week of warnings that “Duo 2FA will soon be necessary,” new students will be required to self-enroll in Duo 2FA via https://passport.gatech.edu in order to continue their use of Georgia Tech computing resources. What does it mean to be “required” to use Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2fA)? What happens when accounts are required to use Duo 2FA, but don’t yet have it set up? Users that have not set up Duo with their account but are required to use it will see login errors on Duo 2FA-enabled applications. For example, web logins will display a Duo 2FA error with helpful text on the right. How do people set up their account to use Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA)? Users can use https://passport.gatech.edu to set up own Duo 2FA account or to assist another use with theirs. Can users sign up for Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA) before their requirement deadline? How soon can students register with Duo? Anyone with GT account can register with Duo via Passport to increase the security of their account, and the user’s Web, VPN, and other logins will start requiring Duo 2FA shortly after this. Can my web application define less secure authentication requirements, eg, not require students or employees to use Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA)? No. Georgia Tech requires consistent security across applications used by a user. Our Web Single-Sign-On System treats all applications equally, requiring Duo 2FA for all logins when a user is required to use Duo 2FA. Can my web application define more secure authentication requirements, eg, always require Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA)? Yes. Applications can require users to use Duo 2FA by checking for Duo 2FA requirements either within Shibboleth, GRS, GTED or GTAD. This is appropriate for high-security, administrative applications. This is generally not appropriate for 99+% of applications which should follow the campus authentication standards. However, if you are implementing a high-security application, you can use the gtAccountEntitlement=/gt/central/services/iam/cas/cas-duo-req-account-prod/enabled to determine if the account is using Duo 2FA before signing onto your application. My application requires Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA) by its users, but I want to allow applicants to use my application before they’d typically have Duo 2FA set up? First, it is unlikely that your application actually requires Duo 2FA, particularly if it is used by Students. It is more likely that users are following their Duo 2FA requirements – not using Duo 2FA for the first weeks of classes and then using Duo 2FA after that. Second, unless your application needs are of the highest security, your application should follow the campus authentication standards – not requiring Duo 2FA of students before their third week of classes. Third, if your application has some high security requirements but also needs to serve applicants or other, less-secure population, then you should consider splitting your application into two: one with full functionality and strong security requirements and another with limited functionality and weaker security requirements. While we’re on the subject of student matriculation, how is GTED’s credit-student affiliation determined? For both historical and practical reasons, GTED (the GT Enterprise Directory) categorizes people as “credit-student” as their first semester approaches, roughly June 20 for students matriculating in the Fall, Dec 1 for Spring and April 1 for Summer. This credit-student affiliation is what enables WiFi and other IT services that students use throughout their Georgia Tech studies. How is GTED’s credit-student affiliation related to Duo Two-Factor Authentication (Duo 2FA)? The credit-student affiliation, assigned to incoming students 30-60 days before their first semester, has nothing to do with Duo 2FA. Instead, requirements to use Duo 2FA are implemented after classes start, as described in the first Q&A above. iGniTe summer students: They start GT classes in the summer and are mostly credit students. Please confirm they require Duo only beginning with the 3rd week in the semester. Yes. iGniTe students are no different than any other Summer student: they are required to use Duo 2FA starting in their third week of classes. Specifically, as Late-Summer-Session classes (starting around June 20), their Duo 2FA requirement would start in early July. Error BuzzAPI error: Can’t associate token: Attempts to onboard a new employee in IAT are met with: BuzzAPI error: Can’t associate token: DH581853EAJMXOB1DDIE to user: pburdell3 This is a known issue, but should be reported to the IAM team if seen. Multiple reasons Duo Prompt can be a blank gray box? For multiple reasons, a user might see a blank iFrame when the authentication process gets to the DUO prompt. How do we resolve Duo Prompt display issues? There are multiple reasons that you can get this behavior. One reason is that iOS has configurable content restrictions that can potentially prevent the Duo Prompt from displaying correctly. If you see a gray box or “session has expired” error instead of the Duo Prompt on your iPhone or iPad, please check whether you have content restrictions enabled or Disable the restrictions. If you see the above error message, then please follow one of the following instructions to resolve the issue: This can be found on the device by going to Settings –> General –> Restrictions –> Websites. First, check whether you have content restrictions enabled or disabled by going to Settings –>General –>Restrictions –>Websites. Option 1: If you do not want to disable the content restrictions entirely, you can add duosecurity.com to the Whitelist within the content restriction page on the iOS device. Option 2: To completely disable content restrictions, uncheck “Limit Adult Content” and change it to “All websites.” Option 3: Settings –> General – > Restrictions –> disable the Restrictions Here is the link https://help.duo.com/s/article/3710?language=en_US Note: Recall that there are multiple reasons that a blank or gray box might appear, during the DUO login process.
