Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes TSR or Technical Services Registry What is a Service Registry / Technical Services Registry at GT? The App Registry /TSC is a new internal service needed to do adequate authorization enforcement for applications. New applications would be onboarding by adding their data to this database, and from there provisioning could be done to SSO. CAS/SSO could then use this data plus data from the Person Registry (GTED) to enforce login authorization for various users. For example, a new employee would be labeled as an active employee in the Person Registry as usual. Data from various authoritative systems is used to label the user account as student, staff, faculty, guest, or other roles. Also grouping tools like GRS/Grouper can add attributes to the user account. These are called Entitlements or Affiliations at GT (based on the Internet2 eduPerson standard). This data would result in a rich set of information that can be used by apps for better authorization decisions. The end result is better access permissions control. These attributes also change over time as the user graduates, leaves/enters GT employment, changes depts, etc. And their access to various systems dynamically changes as a result to reflect needs and security policies. The TSR becomes a bigger factor in the authorization (authZ) part of logins. The TSR can allow an application to better enforce login policies because it has a deeper understanding of the application needs/policies. It will also aid GDPR requests, like “Where is this users data stored? And we expect to be able to provide better troubleshooting tools, better error messages, and generally more transparency in access control, and a host of other benefits, by using this tool. Diagram of Application Registry / Technical Services Registry: (original source at https://lucid.app/lucidchart/134f5754-f130-4841-9b14-addaba121a07/edit?beaconFlowId=AC679C51A1F6B275&page=0_0# ) Why does GT need an Application Registry? There are several gaps in our GT identity and access systems as of 2021. Here are a few that a TSR could help with: -External requirements are changing over time.  

-Laws such as GDPR are one example which creates a need for more knowledge of what data is in applications, and about users. 

-OneUSG is changing their requirements for enterprise systems to raise security. 

-Modernization is constantly needed, as standards evolve and are added. More knowledge of application behaviour helps in this type of planning.

-Aligning with the strategic plan  

-Better insight and enforcement of GT authorizations 

-Better granularity for account permissions (lower risk is less onerous. High risk treated differently) 

-Audits and compliance 

-General security increase 

-Upgrades of SSO are difficult due to lack of app knowledge (like url to use in testing) 

-Required termination actions: 5 business days to remove system/application authorizations 

-Required actions when HR status changes (xfer department, promotion, etc.): 30 calendar day to have access reviewed to ensure appropriateness. 

-Audits are now required every 6 months to ensure all authorizations are still correct GT needs detailed documentation about applications to enforce access control, data provisioning, from the top down. There is also an auditing requirement to determine who has access to what, and who should have access to what. So there is a need to store detailed data about each application, to meet these requirements. There are new laws like GDPR that we need to be able to comply with. Traditionally GT has grown from a distributed IT environment, applications were built independently from authorization and authentication. Departments and app independently solved many implementation issues. To improve consistency, transparency, security we built middleware to help applications and departments better do this. (Phase II). This helped solve many authentication and authorization issues in a more standard and centralized manner. We have reached a point where we need to solve issue s that req deeper understanding of applications so security of apps and data can be more consistently defined, implemented, and audited. So we are entering a new phase of application security at GT. (Phase III) For example, a new employee would be labeled as an active employee in the Person Registry, using authoritative data from the HR system. This data would result in access permissions for an active employee for that user accounts. At SSO time when a login is attempted to ApplicationX, the employee data is used to determine if they match the access rules for login to that service. If not, they are not allowed to login. If they do match, then the credentials are used as usual, and 2FA is used if they are labeled as a 2FA account. TSR Data Storage TSR data is represented as json objects which are stored in an AWS postgres database. The properties of these json objects vary according to the data being stored: TSR Schema TSR onboarding of new applications or new admins TSR onboarding Last edited by John M Bryson, 2022-12-19 10:57:09 Short link to this page Emergency Information Legal & Privacy Information Accessibility Accountability Accreditation Employment © 2014 Georgia Institute of Technology
