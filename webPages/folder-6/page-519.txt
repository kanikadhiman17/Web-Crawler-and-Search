Demo Page for OneUSG Step 1 should be for any user that has trouble, to attempt to login to this test site: If someone has a problem logging in the the production site, you have these folks try the “demo” page and see what SAML attributes display there? This is a simple page designed to display the SAML attribute values as they come across from the IDP: https://idp-demo-prod.bor.usg.edu/ Output may look like this:     Pretend this is PeopleSoft HCM :)

 In general, they will need an EMPLID in GTED for Shibboleth to work, so if they are not in Peoplesoft and do not come across to GTED with an emplid, that is an issue. If they lack an emplid at GT, they may see an error like this:     Invalid Login
    According to our records, you're not a registered user on this site or there was a problem 
    logging you in...
 If they can’t log into this page, they may have more general account issues, or browser issues, and their CSR or TSC should be able to help with that. IAT Step 2 Mage or IAT admins, can use iat.gatech.edu to see if they have an emplid on their person record, and to see if they are identified as an employee.
