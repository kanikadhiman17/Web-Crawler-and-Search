Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes services/newGTID Runbook for the new GTID Manual Request System: The system allows HR initiators to request a GTID for new employees before all of their HR paperwork is completed, and their data is sent to Georgia Tech in the new oneUSG HCM system. The original pilot in Aug 2020, is limited to GTRI HR initiators. Overview The system has a few components. The front end is a service now form and this is the url: https://gatech.service-now.com/hr?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=bdc73e20db0e9cd0ce0f7749af961937&sysparm_category=56cbdb36db260094391b9837db9619df Most people will be told: “You are either not authorized or record is not valid.” which means just that. Currently, new people can only be added by request. (Greg Philips is the service owner,and Digital Business manages the access technically) The form will ask Job Candidate First Name Job Candidate Middle Name Job Candidate Last Name Job Candidate’s Personal Email Address username@domain.com Hiring Department Proposed Date of Hire Then it will create a ticket, and the IAM process will read that and send out an email to the candidate. That email will contain a special url in passport, and if they click that, they will be asked questions, to find an existing GTID, or get a new one created. Then the ticket in servicenow will be updated. Known Errors: “You are either not authorized or record is not valid.” This means that you have not been given permissions to use it. In the pilot only GTRI HR initiators are using it. Technical notes How to see the most recent employee-onboarding requests: gtsql-csv --system util -colnames -q "select created_by,when_created,request_id,first_name,last_name,email,status,email_last_sent,gtid from employee_onboarding_requests_prod where current_timestamp-when_created <interval'2 days' order by when_created desc"
 How to get access: Contact Enterprise Support Desk if you should have access but do not. In Aug 2020, access is controlled by dept (GTRI) and automatic entitlements (HR initiators) , but exceptions/overrides are technically possible. This access request might come in like this: 
Per the HR training on 10/15 provisioned initiators should have access to iat.gatech.edu, 
however, I do not have access.  Can you please advise how I get this access?
 Currently the process is manual, and not automatic for Provisioned Initiators. B^( For the IAT power user, this is a way to do an override to grant access:
