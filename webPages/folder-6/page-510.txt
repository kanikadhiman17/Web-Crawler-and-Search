Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes Grouper What is Grouper? Grouper at GT is an implementation of Incommon.org Grouper. Grouper is an open source, enterprise access management system designed for the highly distributed management environment and heterogeneous information technology environment common to universities. Operating a central access management system that supports both central and distributed IT reduces risk. More information, training, news groups, software downloads, etc can be found on the Incommon sites. Also the ‘Grouper Deployment Guide’ Some useful references are here: https://www.incommon.org/ https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Grouper+Wiki+Home http://www.internet2.edu/products-services/trust-identity/grouper/#service-faq Grouper@GT The manual of how to use Grouper at Georgia Tech can be found here Who uses Grouper? At Georgia Tech, the IAM team is using it for getting data, group math, and provisioning in some cases. Grouper is the likely replacement for the current custom java based “GRS”. It is production for some tasks now. Many other Internet2 schools use it also. ex. Use at Yale is described here: https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Yale+University+Grouper+Page Architecture For understanding how this fits into the GT infrastructure see the diagram below. Basically, it fits into the same place as GRS. It will be a place to define roles/groups for authorization, and the will be provisioned into GTED as LDAP attributes that and application can read at authentication time to decide if a user should be allowed to access an application. Grouper does have some new features, such as a new web based UI, an api for programmatic integration. It uses a standard database backend, and will have some HA capabilities. What is the SLA for login.gatech.edu? Requesting this Service at GT How can I use this to authenticate and authorize in my application? Grouper meeting notes wtih ITG and IAM and also some developer notes for Grouper APIs https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/sites/oit/eis/iam/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B269BAC39-74CF-43DD-9651-8E7C078BAD88%7D&file=Grouper%20Runbook&action=default&RootFolder=%2fsites%2foit%2feis%2fiam%2fSiteAssets%2fGrouper%20Runbook&wdo=6 GT Grouper Service Dynamic course groups At Georgia Tech, we are using the Grouper Loader to read from Banner and populate groups for Students, Instructors and TAs of our courses into the ‘gt:ref:academics:course groups:by term’ folder. In other words, each section of each course has 2 or more groups maintained for it. Maintaining a selection of these groups can be tedious, so we have created a Dynamic course groups facility that enables Policy groups to select course-groups based on Date, College, Department, Subject, etc. GT Grouper LDAP Provisioning Grouper Health Checks There are flows of information from GRS or PS, to GTED, to Grouper (see diagram) and we have various health checks in place to monitor these flows.     nagios.grs2gted_gtIPE              2. on the diagram
