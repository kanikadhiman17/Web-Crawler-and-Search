Staff Job Pay Ranges & Quartiles Each job grade has a corresponding range of pay based on market pay practices and an employee’s development in a job. Each range has quartiles. Individual job performance and job knowledge, as well as the Institute’s financial position, determine the employee’s position in the quartile. In accordance with Georgia Tech and USG policy employees must be paid at the minimum of the grade range, and not the minimum of the quartile. The minimum of the quartile is not guaranteed and subject to other factors, including budget. Click to View Staff Salary Structure Quartile Chart Quartile 1: 0 to 2 years of experience in the job for employees who are novice in the position, are in a learning situation, and do not have substantial experience in the new position. Quartile 2: 2 to 5 years of experience in the job or employees who have gained experience and skill and who are becoming more proficient in the position for which they were hired. They generally meet expectations in their positions. Midpoint The midpoint usually represents the average pay for a position that a fully experienced employee might be paid at this level. Quartile 3: 5 to 10 years of experience in the job for experienced employees who frequently exceed expectations. Quartile 4: 10+ years of experience in the job for employees who have extensive experience and who are consistently exceptional performers. Market Reference Point Each Market Reference Point (MRP) is created by Georgia Tech to reflect the average salary of the same or similar position outside of the Institute. Once set, it becomes the building block of the pay range as well as the midpoint. Salary Structure FAQs What is a Salary Structure?
