Be Well, Georgia Tech’s Benefits Education series and wellbeing resources, provides many wellness opportunities for employees to thrive in the Five Dimensions of Well-being: social, emotional, professional, physical, and spiritual. Attend our workshops, review available resources, and participate in activities to take healthy steps toward your wellness today. Review the interactive calendar below to view and register for events in the series. Mental Health Resources While 1 in 5 people will experience a mental illness during their lifetime, everyone faces challenges in life that can impact their mental health. Our society focuses much more on physical health than mental health, but both are equally important. If you are concerned about your mental health, there are several options available. You are not alone – help is out there, and recovery is possible. It may be hard to talk about your concerns, but simply acknowledging to yourself that you’re struggling is a really big step. Mental Health America mhanational.org Georgia Tech and the USG offer resources to assist you at any stage in your mental health journey. You can also call 988 for matters of mental health crisis. Calling 988 will connect you directly to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is staffed by trained crisis counselors 24/7, 365 days a year.
