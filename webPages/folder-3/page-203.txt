This help content & information General Help Center experience Next Legal Additional Resources About Lumen About Lumen To increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google LLC shares certain legal notices that we receive requesting the removal of content from many of our services with a third-party project called Lumen. Lumen is an independent research project managed by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School that houses, analyzes, and publishes copies of online content takedown requests that have been voluntarily shared with Lumen by various companies, such as Google LLC. Its purpose is to educate the public and facilitate journalistic, academic, or policy-focused research about the global notice & takedown “ecology” and the availability of content on the web. Why do we share with Lumen? Transparency is a core value at Google, especially relating to the availability of information and content in our services. We are committed to being held accountable for and preventing abuse and fraud in our online content moderation practices. Sharing a copy of certain legal removal notices that we receive with the Lumen project for publication is one of the important ways to achieve these objectives. Through the Lumen project, internet users, content owners, and researchers are able to learn about content removal requests that internet platforms, such as Google, receive. Lumen’s goals are to “facilitate research about the different kinds of complaints and requests for removal—both legitimate and questionable—that are being sent to Internet publishers, search engines, and service providers, and to provide as much transparency as possible about the ‘ecology’ of such notices, in terms of who is sending them and why, and to what effect.” What data is shared with Lumen?
