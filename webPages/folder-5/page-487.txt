Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes Kerberos Policies Systems Involved Architecture The kerberos technical service is composed of a master which runs a kadmind daemon, and receives changes, such as password changes. It also has 2 slave servers where changes are propagated every 30 min, and these are read-only for providing kerberos services. These are MIT Kerberos based, not to be confused with the kerberos service built into Microsofts Active Directory. This runs on 3 LINUX servers at GT. These machines are authoritative for passwords and policies. Any updates to that are synched to other systems that need this info, such as GT Active Directory (GTAD), Radius, etc. Authentications to GTED or CAS are ultimately deferred to this MIT based Kerberos service. NOTE: This service is used by other OIT services for authentication, policy, etc, but is not
normally a requestable service for applications at GT. It is recommended instead that
authentication go to CAS, GTED, GTAD, or other services, with Kerberos being by exception
only. The responsibility for password policy definition, assignment, and enforcement are spread throughout several IAM systems at Georgia Tech. This section describes which system does what. System Role(s) Some tools, hints Prism Kerberos GT’s password policies are defined and enforced first and foremost by the Prism Kerberos systems. Account password status – ok, soft-expired, or hard-expired – is 100% determined by the policy assigned in Prism. queryPrismKdc, et al GTAD Policies and expiration dates are not defined in GTAD, but instead password status is propagated to GTAD accounts by disabling them when they are hard-expired in Prism Kerberos, and enabling them otherwise. GTAD does have Active Directory’s default “names cannot be part of passwords” rule and will reject passwords that Prism accepts. Passport tries to help with those cases. IAT, queryGTAD, ad-account-info, ad-userAccountControl Config DB password_policies table While the password policies are technically defined in Prism, those definitions are both incomplete, too technical, and insufficiently structured for most systems. The configdb.password_policies table fixes these gaps: (1) Defining password policies in English, regular expressions, and structured columns; (2) defining to whom different policies are assigned (based on GRS roles in /central/services/iam/password-policies/ folder) gtsql-csv –system config -q “select * from password_policies” Mage Mage has a limited role in password policies; manually assigned password policies (by the setPasswordPolicy script) are saved in the magedb.accounts.password_policy column. Mage is also used to hold password-policy-changing log messages queryMage or gtsql-csv –system mage GRS The /central/services/iam/password-policies/ folder in GRS has a role for each password policy as assigned to the policy by the policy’s configdb.password_policies.entitlement column. FWIW, wverrides for password policies could technically be done in GRS, but they’re done in mage’s accounts table. Passport Passport is obviously the tool people use to change their own passwords and it makes heavy use of the configdb.password_policies table (via BuzzApi’s central.iam.gtaccounts.password_policies endpoint) to help people understand why they have a given policy as well as set valid passwords. Passport is also responsible for mitigating problems where Prism accepts a password but GTAD rejects it because the password contains part the person’s name or username. IAT The policy assigned to an account is visible in IAT, but it is not currently changeable except by the setPasswordPolicy script. Batch Jobs – iam-batch3 Several scripts exist to help manage password policies. The primary of these is the prism-fix-incorrect-password-policies batch job that makes sure each account has the correct policy based on the overrides that might be overridden in magedb.accounts.password_policy or assigned by (grs) entitlements in configdb.password_policies.{name,entitlement_value, ordered by priority} BuzzApi There are two BuzzApi (v3) endpoints involved in password policies: (1) central.iam.gtaccounts.password_policies can be used to read various properties of GT’s policies, and (2) central.iam.gtaccounts can be used to read the kerberos_password_info for an account.
