The Red Flags Rule implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. After consideration of the size and complexity of the Institute's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the Institute's activities, the Institute determined that this Program was appropriate. Policy Statement Requirements of the Red Flags Rule Under the Red Flags Rule, the Institute is required to establish an Identity Theft Prevention Program. The program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: Identify relevant Red Flags for new and existing covered accounts. and incorporate those Red Flags into the Program; Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program; Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected in order to help prevent and mitigate Identity Theft; and Ensure the Program is updated periodically to reflect changes in risks to students or to the safety and soundness of the Institute from Identity Theft. Oversight Responsibility for developing, implementing, and updating this Program lies with an Identity Theft Committee (Committee) for the Institute. The Committee is headed by the Chief Information Security Officer who is the Program Administrator. The Institute's Chief Information Officer, the Vice President for Legal Affairs and Risk Management, and such other individuals as may be appointed by the President of the Institute comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The Program Administrator is responsible for ensuring appropriate training of Institute staff on the Program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of Red Flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating Identity Theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances, and considering periodic changes to the Program. Staff Training and Reports Institute staff responsible for implementing the Program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the Program Administrator in the detection of Red Flags and the steps to be taken when a Red Flag is detected. Institute employees are expected to notify the Program Administrator once they become aware of an incident of Identity Theft or of the Institute's failure to comply with this Program. At least annually, or sooner if requested by the Program Administrator, Institute staff responsible for development, implementation, and administration of the Program shall report to the Program Administrator on compliance with this Program. The report should address such issues as effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening and maintenance of Covered Accounts, service provider arrangements, significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response, and recommendations for changes to the Program. Service Provider Arrangements In the event the Institute engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more Covered Accounts, the Institute will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of Identity Theft: Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and Require, by contract, that service providers review the Institute's Program and report any Red Flags to the Program Administrator or the Institute employee with primary oversight of the service provider relationship. Non-disclosure of Specific Practices For the effectiveness of the Identity Theft Prevention Program, knowledge about specific Red Flag identification, detection, mitigation, and prevention practices may need to be limited to the Committee who developed this Program and to those employees with a need to know them. Any documents that may have been produced or are produced in order to develop or implement this program that list or describe such specific practices and the information those documents contain are considered confidential and should not be shared with other Institute employees or the public. The Program Administrator shall inform the Committee and those employees with a need to know the information of those documents or specific practices which should be maintained in a confidential manner. Program Updates The Committee will periodically review and update the Program to reflect changes in risks to students and the soundness of the Institute from Identity Theft. In doing so, the Committee will consider the Institute's experiences with Identity Theft situations, changes in Identity Theft methods, changes in Identity Theft detection and prevention methods, and changes in the Institute's business arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the Program Administrator will determine whether changes to the Program, including the listing of Red Flags, are warranted. If warranted, the Committee will update the Program.
