Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes Identity and Access Management at GT Identity and Access Management at GT If you have been sent to this page, it is likely because you are using an outdated link, to iam.gatech.edu, our legacy Georgia Tech IAM services site. This legacy site is being replaced by http://iamweb1.iam.gatech.edu/docs/ as the Georgia Tech Identity and Access Mgt team internal and external documentation repository. Content issues can be reported to iam-support@oit.gatech.edu. If you need to request IAM services at Georgia Tech, please use this link “How to request IAM services”, which will … 1. gather your needs, 2. submit a Footprints ticket for you, and 3. begin any data stewardship or security overview that is needed. It is your responsibility to provide information as requested by IAM, Cybersecurity, database admins, and data stewards as these questions may arise. This is the method to get access to login.gatech.edu/CAS for your application, Shibboleth authentication for your application, get a GTED/LDAP searcher account, and request data from Identity and Access Management for your application. Note: Routine issues and questions, about IAM or IAM-related topics, should go through 
central OIT support at support@oit.gatech.edu as usual. This team is sized appropriately 
for this volume, and trained to get questions to the correct team. Bypassing this process 
will likely not obtain faster service. If you have been asked to submit a project request for the IAM team, you can go directly to this form mentioned above.
