Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes services/BuzzApi/overview Introduction BuzzApi is a unified API system that presents web services for several data resources and applications at Georgia Tech. Its goals are to make both providing and consuming web services easy, consistent, sustainable and secure. In order to do this, BuzzApi standardizes several aspects of the web services: Resource types: The target of an operation is specified with a resource type. For example, to search for people, you might use the central.iam.services.people resource Operations: There are five main operations: Create, Read, Search, Update, and Delete. There are also api-management operations: Documentation, Ping and Provide. Resource Providers: BuzzApi requires providers to be created for each type of Georgia Tech data. BuzzApi then serves as a broker between Resource Consumers (web-service clients) and these Providers, routing requests to the right providers and routing responses back to the requesters. Technology: BuzzApi is inherently a RESTful/JSON system on top of RabbitMQ queues. Java, Python, Ruby, PowerShell Client & Provider bindings have been created atop this foundation and others are expected. Ask the gted email list to see what the community recommends for your favorite technologies Network connections: All resources are accessed via the https://api.gatech.edu and https://test.api.gatech.edu URLs. Authentication: The same Application and User sessions are used across all operations and resource types. These can be established with usernames/passwords or CAS-proxy authentication. Authorization: Applications have to be authorized for the resource types & operations they can access. Fine-grained authorizations are up to the resource providers. For instance, BuzzApi can limit an application’s access to reading the People resource, but finer-grained limitations are the Provider’s responsibilities, eg, only being able to read employee information.
