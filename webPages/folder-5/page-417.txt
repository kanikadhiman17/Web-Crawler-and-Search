The policies within the Library contain the following information: reason for policy, policy statement, policy scope statement, definitions and procedures. Most policies also contain links for any forms or additional information associated with the policy. The primary objectives of the policy library are: Resource for policy owners in developing new policies or updating existing policies. Tool for stakeholders to identify policies quickly and accurately that impact job function. Central repository for all Institute-level policies. Institute policies at Georgia Tech must have Institute level approval. In order to do this, Institute policies need to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate committees and authorizing bodies. All Institute policies will be reviewed and approved as described in the Institute Policy Development & Life Cycle Process. Once an Institute policy has been approved, it will be published and made publically available on the Policy Library and within the appropriate "policy book". Campus-wide announcements will be made for new policies or changes to policy, when appropriate. Please contact the Policy Owner, listed within the policy information at the top of the policy page, to address any specific questions or concerns. Please note: The Policy Library does not contain college, division, or departmental policies. For information on policies implemented by a specific college, school, division or department, please check their respective web pages.
