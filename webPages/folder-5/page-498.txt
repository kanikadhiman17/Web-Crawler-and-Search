Identity and Access Management Home Index Search Log In History Latest Changes services/Shelldap Sheldap Georgia Tech’s Shelldap service is an LDAP wrapper around our Whitepages LDAP service. This wrapper greatly simplifies doing a simple search for someone by name, email address, account name, or even phone number. In short, you don’t have to say what type of search you’re doing. Just specify “cn=" when you want to look someone up. Here’s what you need to know: Host ldap.gatech.edu Search base dc=gatech,dc=edu Example: Using ldapsearch, a common LDAP command available on Linux systems, find someone named “Frank Pozner”. $ ldapsearch -xLLLH ldap://ldap.gatech.edu -b dc=gatech,dc=edu 'cn=frank pozner'

For example, you could also use any of these searches to find that same entry for Frank: cn=pozner,frank cn=frank.pozner@gatech.edu cn=lpozner3 cn=404-385-1980 cn=4043851980 cn=51980 Notice that for phone numbers, dashes are optional, and you can search on as little as the last 5 digits.
