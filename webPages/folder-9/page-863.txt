She develops brain-music interfaces and other physiological sensor systems that reveal aspects of her internal cognitive and affective state, those left unexpressed by sound or gesture, to an audience. As an electronic music composer and improviser, she maintains a brain-body performance practice. Grace strives to integrate the manners of conventional emotional and musical expression that she learned as a flutist with the new forms available to her as an electronic musician, using brain- computer interface to reveal aspects of her internal mental state, those left unexpressed by sound or gesture, to an audience. In recent years she has performed this music in academic and popular music venues, conferences and residencies in the United States, UK, Australia, Germany, Singapore, South Korea, China, and Japan, and released three records of this mind- body music. Grace recently completed a fellowship at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, USA, where she collaborated with the Neurology research team at Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital in the development of epilepsy therapies using electronic music and sound. Grace was previously a postdoctoral fellow at the MIT Media Lab, where she researched the link between cortical and physiological arousal, and developed new music interfaces that modulate this link to bring well- being. In August 2018 Grace will be joining the faculty at Georgia Tech as an assistant professor of Music Technology. Grace completed a Ph.D. in Music and Cognitive Science at UCSD, where she studied the expressive movements and brain dynamics supporting music engagement at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience. During her Ph.D. studies she completed a yearlong position at Ircam in Paris, where she collaborated on an interactive sound installation and performed experiments studying the effect of active involvement on music listening. She completed her undergraduate and Masters work in Music, Science, and Technology at CCRMA, Stanford University.
