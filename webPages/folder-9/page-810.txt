Emily Bynum, HP Enterprise Read more testimonials ‚ÄúI have found the perfect app ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a combination of the simple calendar layout + the surprising amount of simple yet useful functionality (adding images, color coding, being able to easily copy or drag and drop, right clicking to bring up more options).‚Äù Karolina Read more Google Play reviews User Story: Hope Channel ‚ÄúHope Channel was hiring more people and our activities were increasing a lot more, so we decided to go with the premium option. Little did I know, it was the best decision I made. We all know with one click what projects we are working on, what is happening next, who is involved, deadlines and so much other important information. As a manager, I know exactly how long a project takes from initial idea to finished production, and this tracking makes my job easier.‚Äú Daniel Claudet, Manager, Hope Channel Southeast Asia Read the story Schedule Work Optimize use of resources, avoid scheduling conflicts, and delegate tasks without losing sight of the big picture. Keep all the details in one place with images, files, links, notes, and time-stamped event comments. Streamline communication and easily maintain records. Learn more Teamup continues to be a critical part of our operation here at Chicago Yacht Works. We have mechanical technicians, fiberglass repair technicians, sub-contractors and daily boat launch/haul-out tasks. We previously used a combination of whiteboards, outlook/google calendars (yuck!), and spreadsheets to schedule everything. It was a big headache! We now use Teamup to schedule our technicians ‚Äì a vast improvement over the whiteboard method. The ability to prevent overlapping events in each technician‚Äôs calendar is a huge advantage. Jonathan Paige, Chicago Yacht Works Read more user stories ‚ÄúYour calendar has been a lifesaver in desperate times. Our family of seven needed a way to schedule AND track AND assign who would accompany my inlaws, both nonagenarians, to medical appointments. By assigning subcalendars to each of us, with different colors (and black for ‚ÄúUNASSIGNED‚Äù), we are able to see when the next appointment is, who‚Äôs got it, and to fill in descriptions of items discussed in the Description field.‚Äù John Donohue Share your story User Story: Field Service Operations ‚ÄúThe varied permissions are still OUR biggest luxury with this calendar as well. We have so many varied positions and each one only needs a piece of the calendar to do their job. With Teamup, we can basically organize the entire company‚Äôs production process without confusing or overloading any of our departments with information that they do not need.‚Äù Teresa Ortiz, Project Manager, Holbrook Asphalt Read the story Manage Availability Eliminate the back-and-forth of checking on availability. Enable self-booking and keep central access control: no risk of unwanted alteration to existing bookings. Customize information disclosure based on user roles; keep sensitive data safe and ensure protection of privacy. Learn more We are a cancer treatment hospital, medical center, basic science and clinical research facility for type 1 diabetes, and have a graduate school for training scientists of the future. We use Teamup in our Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute because we can no longer freely use all of the equipment, instruments, and services available in our building without first controlling traffic in our labs and specialty rooms. It is a terrific solution. John Kaddis, Assistant Professor, City of Hope National Medical Center Share your story ‚ÄúWe are a professional ballet company in NY (with approx. 90 dancers), along with the school for students ages 3-18. We house 9 studios total, shared among different programs and departments (including outside rentals). It is immensely efficient to have a streamlined system (our old way was having an excel spreadsheet that didn‚Äôt allow remote access) that is simple yet effective.‚Äù Miki Shintani, Rehearsal Planning Manage, American Ballet Theatre Read more stories User Story: Horse Stable Scheduling ‚ÄúThe good thing about Teamup is that you can really adapt it to your needs very easily. Thus, with one or more individual calendars, you can also manage allocations for riding arenas, halls, stalls, equipment, and more at the stable‚Ä¶ The big advantage compared to scheduling appointments with WhatsApp and other messenger services is that you can always keep an eye on future appointments (e.g. hoof groomer comes in two weeks). Overlaps of appointments become immediately visible and the calendar can be set to prevent them from being allowed in the first place.‚Äú Markus Erdmann, Publisher, Country-Reiten.de Read the story Share Events Publicize events anywhere with easy share and embed options. Consolidate events from multiple sources into one view. Decentralize event management efficiently and securely. Reduce information silos across organizational units and increase transparency for better collaboration. Learn more I‚Äôve been using Teamup to organise a couple of virtual conference programs ‚Äì a nice thing about it is that it automatically adjusts to the local timezone of users, and because virtual conferences happen across multiple timezones this has made it much easier for people as they don‚Äôt need to do any timezone calculations for themselves. David Warton, Professor, UNSW Sydney Read more testimonials ‚ÄúI explained to a user how he can use the Share button of the filter tool to get a tailored view of the calendar that can easily be shared. He was pretty excited about it üòé GENIUS!!! IT WORKED EXACTLY AS I NEED IT TOO!!!

We feel like we were saved from some nightmare trying to manage the calendar on one end, the events on another and then the registration on yet another platform.‚Äú Benoit Rouleau, Vice pr√©sident, V√©lo Plaisirs Leave your comment User Story: UN Web TV Live Schedule ‚ÄúThe UN Webcast team is very busy.
