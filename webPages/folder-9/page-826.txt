Our school welcomes students from all majors on campus to pursue one of our minors -- due to overwhelming demand, we are currently limited to a very small amount of new students per year. Our Minors We offer a Minor in Music with General Emphasis and a Minor in Music Technology. The Minor in Music with General Emphasis blends music technology classes with experience playing in a musical ensemble, while the Minor in Music Technology focuses solely on classes in the music technology track. If you choose the Minor in Music with General Emphasis, you must choose a concentration in either vocal or instrumental music. To better understand the difference between our two minors, refer to the reference materials below.
