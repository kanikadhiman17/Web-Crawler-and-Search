At Georgia Tech, music technology students master existing technologies and create the technologies we’ll use to enjoy music in the future. Music technology students are just as passionate about making music as they are about the technology that makes it possible. They play the clarinet in band and develop mobile applications that teach others to play it too. They perform classical music in the symphony orchestra and make electronic music in a laptop orchestra. They record with their rock band in our studio and also design new acoustical treatments to make the studio sound better. They play the classical organ, and then go home to build one of their own in their garage. For more general questions and inquiries, you can also email us at questions@music.gatech.edu.
