The power design holds to influence the way we live, to physically change and adapt the spaces we inhabit, as well as how we can use it to achieve the change we want to see in neighborhoods, towns, cities, and across regions. More than that, design is a tool that empowers neighborhood residents to imagine and create the places they want. In a rapidly changing world, design can create more resilient and just places as easily as it can contribute to deepening gaps.
