The Department seeks individuals who are committed to excellent teaching that engages and inspires students. Teaching responsibilities will include undergraduate and graduate courses in history/theory, coursework and seminars, and design studios as appropriate. The successful candidate will join the Doctorate of Design faculty and will teach and advise students in their area of expertise. Over the past decade, The Department of Architecture has integrated issues of environment and social justice into all aspects of the curriculum. This position offers an opportunity to rethink the content and format of the current three-semester history survey courses with considerations of how design engages the natural environment and all peoples, inclusive of ethnicity, economic standing, gender, and religion. In addition, the Department encourages collaboration and interdisciplinary initiatives with the Departments of Interior Architecture and Landscape Architecture + Environmental Urban Design. The Department of Architecture also enjoys close ties with the FIU Wolfsonian Public Humanities Lab, a synergistic hub for community engagement in the humanities; and with the FIU Institute of Environment, a comprehensive solutions center dedicated to combating environmental crises.
