Based on that cornerstone, the goal of CivicCon has been to contribute to the creation of an informed community that is engaged in civic conversations. The result has been citizen-powered change in which civic engagement drives community development, progress, and change, with elected officials following the will of educated and engaged citizens. CivicCon is a partnership of the Pensacola News Journal and the Studer Community Institute to make our community a better place to live, grow, work and invest through smart planning and civic conversations.
